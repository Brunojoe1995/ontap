[.lead]
You can upgrade ONTAP nondisruptively for a two-node MetroCluster configuration. This method has several steps: initiating a negotiated switchover, updating the cluster at the "`failed`" site, initiating switchback, and then repeating the process on the cluster at the other site.

This procedure is for two-node MetroCluster configurations running ONTAP 9.2 or earlier only.
+
Do not use this procedure if you have a four-node MetroCluster configuration.
+
If you have a two-node MetroCluster configuration running ONTAP 9.3 or later, perform an xref:task_upgrade_andu_sm.html[automated nondisruptive upgrade using System Manager].

. Set the privilege level to advanced, entering *y* when prompted to continue: `set -privilege advanced`
+
The advanced prompt (`*>`) appears.

. On the cluster to be upgraded, install the new ONTAP software image as the default: `system node image update -package package_location -setdefault true -replace-package true`
+
----
cluster_B::*> system node image update -package http://www.example.com/NewImage.tgz -setdefault true -replace-package true
----

. Verify that the target software image is set as the default image: `system node image show`
+
The following example shows that `NewImage` is set as the default image:
+
----
cluster_B::*> system node image show
                    Is      Is                           Install
Node     Image      Default Current Version              Date
-------- -------    ------- ------- -------------------- -------------------
node_B_1
         OldImage  false   true    X.X.X                MM/DD/YYYY TIME
         NewImage  true    false   Y.Y.Y                MM/DD/YYYY TIME
2 entries were displayed.
----

. If the target software image is not set as the default image, then change it: `system image modify {-node * -iscurrent false} -isdefault true`
. Verify that all cluster SVMs are in a health state: `metrocluster vserver show`
. On the cluster that is not being updated, initiate a negotiated switchover: `metrocluster switchover`
+
The operation can take several minutes. You can use the metrocluster operation show command to verify that the switchover is completed.
+
In the following example, a negotiated switchover is performed on the remote cluster ("`cluster_A`"). This causes the local cluster ("`cluster_B`") to halt so that you can update it.
+
----
cluster_A::> metrocluster switchover

Warning: negotiated switchover is about to start. It will stop all the data
         Vservers on cluster "cluster_B" and
         automatically re-start them on cluster
         "cluster_A". It will finally gracefully shutdown
         cluster "cluster_B".

. Verify that all cluster SVMs are in a health state: `metrocluster vserver show`
. Resynchronize the data aggregates on the "`surviving`" cluster: `metrocluster heal -phase aggregates`
+
After upgrading MetroCluster IP configurations to ONTAP 9.5 or later, the aggregates will be in a degraded state for a short period before resynchronizing and returning to a mirrored state.
+
----
cluster_A::> metrocluster heal -phase aggregates
[Job 130] Job succeeded: Heal Aggregates is successful.
----

. Verify that the healing operation was completed successfully: `metrocluster operation show`
+
----
cluster_A::> metrocluster operation show
Operation: heal-aggregates
State: successful
Start Time: MM/DD/YYYY TIME
End Time: MM/DD/YYYY TIME

+
----
cluster_A::> metrocluster heal -phase root-aggregates
[Job 131] Job succeeded: Heal Root Aggregates is successful.
----

. Verify that the healing operation was completed successfully: `metrocluster operation show`

----
cluster_A::> metrocluster operation show
Operation: heal-root-aggregates

Start Time: MM/DD/YYYY TIME
End Time: MM/DD/YYYY TIME
Errors: -
----

. On the halted cluster, boot the node from the LOADER prompt: `boot_ontap`
. Wait for the boot process to finish, and then verify that all cluster SVMs are in a health state: `metrocluster vserver show`
. Perform a switchback from the "`surviving`" cluster: `metrocluster switchback`
. Verify that the switchback was completed successfully: `metrocluster operation show`
+
----
cluster_A::> metrocluster operation show
Operation: switchback
State: successful
Start Time: MM/DD/YYYY TIME
End Time: MM/DD/YYYY TIME
Errors: -
----

. Verify that all cluster SVMs are in a health state: `metrocluster vserver show`
. Repeat all previous steps on the other cluster.
. Verify that the MetroCluster configuration is healthy:

Command completed. Use the "metrocluster check show -instance"
command or sub-commands in "metrocluster check" directory for
detailed results.
To check if the nodes are ready to do a switchover or switchback
operation, run "metrocluster switchover -simulate" or "metrocluster
switchback -simulate", respectively.

 .. If you want to view more detailed results, use the metrocluster check run command: `metrocluster check aggregate show``metrocluster check config-replication show``metrocluster check lif show``metrocluster check node show`
 .. Set the privilege level to advanced: `set -privilege advanced`
 .. Simulate the switchover operation: `metrocluster switchover -simulate`
 .. Review the results of the switchover simulation: `metrocluster operation show`

You should perform any post-upgrade tasks.
