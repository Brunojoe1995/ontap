Properly preparing for an ONTAP upgrade helps you identify and mitigate potential upgrade risks or blockers before you begin the upgrade process. During upgrade preparation, you can also identify any special considerations you might need to account for before you upgrade. For example, if SSL FIPs mode is enabled on your cluster and the administrator accounts use SSH public keys for authentication, you must verify that the host key algorithm is supported in your target ONTAP release.  

You should do the following to prepare for an upgrade:

. link:choose-target-version.html[Choose your target ONTAP release].

. Review the link:https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2492508[ONTAP release notes^] for the target release.
+
The “Upgrade cautions” section describes potential issues that you should be aware of before upgrading to the new release. The “What's new” and “Known problems and limitations” sections describe new system behavior after upgrading to the new release.

. link:confirm-configuration.html[Confirm ONTAP support for your configuration].
+
Your hardware platform, cluster management switches and MetroCluster IP switches must support the target release.  If your cluster is configured for SAN, the SAN configuration must be fully supported. 

. link:task_verifying_the_lif_failover_configuration.html[Verify the LIF failover configuration].
+
Before you perform an upgrade, you must verify that the failover policies and failover groups are configured correctly.

. link:task_check_for_common_configuration_errors_using_config_advisor.html[Use Active IQ Config Advisor to verify that you have no common configuration errors.]

. Review the supported ONTAP link:concept_upgrade_paths.html#supported-upgrade-paths-for-on-premises-ontap-and-ontap-select[upgrade paths] to determine if you can perform a direct upgrade or if you must complete the upgrade in stages.

. link:create-upgrade-plan.html[Create an upgrade plan].
+
If you have an active SupportEdge contract for link:https://aiq.netapp.com/[Active IQ Digital Advisor], plan your upgrade with Upgrade Advisor.  If you do not have access to Active IQ Digital Advisor, create your own upgrade plan.

. link:special-considerations.html[Verify special considerations] for your cluster.
+
If certain configurations exist on your cluster, there are specific actions you need to take before you begin an ONTAP software upgrade.
