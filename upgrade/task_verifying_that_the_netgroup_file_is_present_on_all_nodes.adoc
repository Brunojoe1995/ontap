Before you upgrade or revert ONTAP, if you have loaded netgroups into storage virtual machines (SVMs), you must verify that the netgroup file is present on each node. A missing netgroup file on a node can cause an upgrade or revert to fail.

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced: 
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----

. Display the netgroup status for each SVM: 
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver services netgroup status
----

. Verify that for each SVM, each node shows the same netgroup file hash value: 
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver services name-service netgroup status`
----
+
If this is the case, you can skip the next step and proceed with the upgrade or revert. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

. On any one node of the cluster, manually load the netgroup file: 
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver services netgroup load -vserver vserver_name -source uri
----
+
This command downloads the netgroup file on all nodes. If a netgroup file already exists on a node, it is overwritten.
