If an automated ONTAP software upgrade pauses because of an error, you should resolve the error and then continue the upgrade.  After the error is resolved, you can choose to continue the automated upgrade process or you can cancel it and complete the upgrade process manually. If you choose to continue the automated upgrade, do not perform any of the upgrade steps manually.
