[.lead]
After upgrading ONTAP, you must resume any SnapMirror relationships that were suspended.

Existing SnapMirror relationships must have been suspended by using the `snapmirror quiesce` command, and the cluster must have been nondisruptively upgraded.

. Resume transfers for each SnapMirror relationship that was previously quiesced: `snapmirror resume *`
+
This command resumes the transfers for all quiesced SnapMirror relationships.

. Verify that the SnapMirror operations have resumed: `snapmirror show`

For each SnapMirror relationship, verify that the Relationship Status is *Idle*. If the status is *Transferring*, wait for the SnapMirror transfer to complete, and then reenter the command to verify that the status has changed to *Idle*.

For each SnapMirror relationship that is configured to run on a schedule, you should verify that the first scheduled SnapMirror transfer completes successfully.
