For each SnapMirror relationship, verify that the Relationship Status is *Idle*. If the status is *Transferring*, wait for the SnapMirror transfer to complete, and then reenter the command to verify that the status has changed to *Idle*.

For each SnapMirror relationship that is configured to run on a schedule, you should verify that the first scheduled SnapMirror transfer completes successfully.
