[.lead]
The Disk Qualification Package (DQP) adds full support for newly qualified drives.

ONTAP treats disk drives differently than normally expected. For example, ONTAP allocates different sector sizes than those specified by manufacturers.  The DQP contains the proper parameters for ONTAP for all newly qualified drives. Therefore, if you are running a version of ONTAP with a DQP that does not contain information for a newly qualified drive, ONTAP will not have the information to properly configure the drive.


You need to download and install the DQP in the following situations.   A best practice is to also update the DQP regularly; for example, every quarter or semi-annually.

* Whenever you upgrade to a new version of ONTAP.
+
The DQP is not updated as part of an ONTAP upgrade.

* Whenever you add a new drive type or size to the node
+
For example, if you already have 1-TB drives and add 2-TB drives, you need to check for the latest DQP update.

* Whenever you update the disk firmware
* Whenever newer disk firmware or DQP files are available
