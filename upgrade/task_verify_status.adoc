= Verify status

[.lead]
Before you upgrade, you should verify the following:

* HA pair status
* LDAP status (for ONTAP 9.2 or later)
* DNS server status (for ONTAP 9.2 or later),
* Networking and storage status (for MetroCluster configurations)

== Verifying HA status

Before performing a nondisruptive upgrade, you should verify that storage failover is enabled for each HA pair. If the cluster consists of only two nodes, you should also verify that cluster HA is enabled.

You do not need to verify the HA status if you plan to perform a disruptive upgrade, because this upgrade method does not require storage failover.

. Verify that storage failover is enabled and possible for each HA pair: `storage failover show`
+
This example shows that storage failover is enabled and possible on node0 and node1:
+
----
cluster1::> storage failover show
                              Takeover
Node           Partner        Possible State
-------------- -------------- -------- -------------------------------------
node0          node1          true     Connected to node1
node1          node0          true     Connected to node0
2 entries were displayed.
----
+
If necessary, you can enable storage failover by using the storage failover modify command.

. If the cluster consists of only two nodes (a single HA pair), verify that cluster HA is configured: `cluster ha show`
+
This example shows that cluster HA is configured:
+
----
cluster1::> cluster ha show
High Availability Configured: true
----
+
If necessary, you can enable cluster HA by using the cluster ha modify command.

== Verifying LDAP status (ONTAP 9.2 and later)

Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, if LDAP is used by your storage virtual machines (SVMs), you must have an established LDAP connection to perform a nondisruptive upgrade. You should verify the LDAP connection before you begin the upgrade.

The task does not apply if you are upgrading from ONTAP 9.1 or earlier.

. Check the LDAP status: `ldap check -vserver vserver_name`
. If the LDAP status is down, modify it: `ldap client modify -client-config LDAP_client -ldap-servers ip_address`
. Verify that the LDAP status is up: `ldap check -vserver vserver_name`

== Verifying DNS server status (ONTAP 9.2 and later)

Beginning with ONTAP 9.2 and later, you should verify the status of your Domain Name Service (DNS) server before and after performing a nondisruptive upgrade.

The task does not apply if you are upgrading from ONTAP 9.1 or earlier.

. Check the status of your DNS servers: `dns check -vserver vserver_name`
+
An up status indicates the service is running. A down status indicates that the service is not running.

. If the DNS server is down, modify it: `dns modify -vserver vserver_name -domains domain_name -name-servers name_server_ipaddress`
. Verify the status of the DNS server is up.
