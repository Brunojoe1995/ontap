Before you upgrade ONTAP, you should confirm that your configuration can support the target release.

. Confirm that your hardware platform as well as your cluster and management switches are supported in the target release.
+
You can upgrade in a transitional state, but ultimately your NX-OS (cluster network switches), IOS (management network switches), and reference configuration file (RCF) software versions should be compatible with the version of ONTAP to which you are upgrading.

. Confirm that your MetroCluster IP switches are supported in the target release.

. If your cluster and management switches do not have the minimum software versions for the target ONTAP release, upgrade to supported software versions.

. If your cluster is configured for SAN, confirm that the SAN configuration is fully supported.
+
All SAN components--including the target ONTAP software version, host OS and patches, required Host Utilities software, multipathing software, and adapter drivers and firmware--should be supported.

. If you are transitioning from 7-Mode using the 7-Mode Transition Tool, confirm that the tool supports transition to the ONTAP version to which you are upgrading.
+
All the projects in the tool must be in the completed or aborted state before you upgrade the 7-Mode Transition Tool that supports the ONTAP version to which you are upgrading.
