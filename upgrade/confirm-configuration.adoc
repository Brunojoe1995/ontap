Before you upgrade ONTAP, you should confirm that your configuration can support the target release.

.All configurations

* Confirm that your hardware platform as well as your cluster and management switches are supported in the target release.
+
You can upgrade in a transitional state, but ultimately your cluster network switches (NX-OS), management network switches (IOS), and reference configuration file (RCF) software versions should be compatible with the version of ONTAP to which you are upgrading.

* If your cluster and management switches do not have the minimum software versions for the target ONTAP release, upgrade to supported software versions.

.MetroCluster configurations

Before you upgrade, if you have a MetroCluster configuration, confirm that your MetroCluster IP switches are supported in the target release.

.SAN configurations

Before you upgrade, if your cluster is configured for SAN, confirm that the SAN configuration is fully supported.

All SAN components--including the target ONTAP software version, host OS and patches, required Host Utilities software, multipathing software, and adapter drivers and firmware--should be supported.
