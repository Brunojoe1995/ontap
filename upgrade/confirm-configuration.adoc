Before you upgrade ONTAP, you should confirm that your configuration can support the target release.

== All configurations

Use https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] to confirm that your hardware platform and cluster and management switches are supported in the target ONTAP release.

Cluster and management switches include the cluster network switches (NX-OS), management network switches (IOS), and reference configuration file (RCF).

If your cluster and management switches are supported but are not running the minimum software versions required for the target ONTAP release, upgrade to supported software versions.

NetApp recommends that you upgrade the software of your switches before you upgrade the ONTAP software. 

== MetroCluster configurations

Before you upgrade ONTAP, if you have a MetroCluster configuration, confirm that your MetroCluster IP switches are supported in the target release.

== SAN configurations

Before you upgrade ONTAP, if your cluster is configured for SAN, confirm that the SAN configuration is fully supported.

All SAN components--including the target ONTAP software version, host OS and patches, required Host Utilities software, multipathing software, and adapter drivers and firmware--should be supported.
