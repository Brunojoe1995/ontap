[.lead]

You should upgrade your ONTAP software on a regular cadence. Upgrading ONTAP allows you to take advantage of new and enhanced features and functionality and implement current fixes for known issues.

== Major ONTAP upgrades

A major ONTAP upgrade or feature release typically includes:

** New ONTAP features
** Key infrastructure changes, such as fundamental changes to NetApp WAFLÂ® operation or RAID operation
** File system changes that require following a specific upgrade process to move to the new release 
** Support for new NetApp-engineered hardware systems 
** Support for replacement hardware components such as newer network interface cards or host bus adapters

New ONTAP releases are entitled to full support for 3 years. NetApp recommends that you run the newest release for 1 year after general availability (GA) and then use the remaining time within the full support window to plan for your transition to a newer ONTAP release. 

== Minor (patch) ONTAP upgrades

Patch upgrades deliver timely fixes for critical bugs that cannot wait for the next major ONTAP feature release. Non-critical patch upgrades should be applied every 3-6 months. Critical patch upgrades should be applied as soon as possible.

== ONTAP release dates and support levels

Starting with the ONTAP 9.8 software release, NetApp delivers an ONTAP feature release two times per calendar year. Though plans are subject to change, the intent is to deliver new ONTAP releases in the second and fourth quarter of each calendar year. Use this information to plan the time frame of your upgrade to take advantage of the latest ONTAP release.
