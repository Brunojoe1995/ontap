You should upgrade your ONTAP software on a regular cadence and implement service updates as recommended.  Upgrading ONTAP allows you to take advantage of the most recent ONTAP features and improvements and implement current fixes for known issues.

* *ONTAP upgrades*
+
New ONTAP releases are entitled to full support for 3 years. NetApp recommends that you run the newest release for 1 year after general availability (GA) and then use the remaining time within the full support window to plan for your transition to a newer ONTAP release. 

* *Service updates*
+
Service updates deliver timely fixes for critical bugs that cannot wait for the next ONTAP feature release. Non-critical service updates should be applied every 3-6 months. Critical service updates should be applied as soon as possible.

NOTE: NetApp releases new ONTAP versions and service updates on the cadence model described in the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/ontap-release-model[ONTAP Release Model].  You can use this information to help determine when you want to upgrade based on the release schedule.
