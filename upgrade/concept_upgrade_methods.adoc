[.lead]

You can perform an automated or manual nondisruptive upgrade of your ONTAP software.  The method you use to upgrade ONTAP depends upon your configuration, your current ONTAP version, and the number of nodes in your cluster.  For example, if you have a MetroCluster configuration with 4 nodes running ONTAP 9.3 or later, you should perform an automated nondisruptive upgrade (ANDU).  If you have a MetroCluster configuration with with 8 nodes running ONTAP 9.2 or earlier, you should perform a manual nondisruptive upgrade.

ONTAP software upgrades can be performed using System Manager or the ONTAP command line interface (CLI).  ANDU using System Manager is the recommended upgrade method, if it is supported by your configuration.

== Nondisruptive ONTAP upgrades

Nondisruptive upgrades take advantage of ONTAPâ€™s high-availability (HA) failover technology to ensure that clusters continue to serve data during the upgrade.  In ONTAP, a nondisruptive upgrade can be executed using the rolling upgrade process or the batch upgrade process.

* *Rolling upgrade*
In the rolling upgrade process, a node is taken offline and upgraded while its partner takes over its storage. When the node upgrade is complete, the partner node gives control back to the original owning node and the process is repeated on the partner node. Each additional HA pair is upgraded in sequence until all HA pairs are running the target release.  The rolling upgrade process is the default for clusters with fewer than 8 nodes. 

* *Batch upgrade*
In the batch upgrade process, the cluster is divided into several batches, each of which contains multiple HA pairs.  In the first batch, half of the nodes are upgraded, followed by their HA partners. The process is then repeated sequentially for the remaining batches. The batch upgrade process is the default for clusters of 8 nodes or more.

Nondisruptive ONTAP software upgrades can be automated or manual.  For automated nondisruptive upgrades, ONTAP automatically installs the target ONTAP image on each node, validates the cluster components to ensure that the cluster can be upgraded nondisruptively, and then executes a batch or rolling upgrade in the background based on the number of nodes.  For manual nondisruptive upgrades, the administrator manually confirms that each node in the cluster is ready for upgrade, then performs the steps to execute the rolling upgrade process.

== Recommended ONTAP upgrade methods based on configuration

Upgrade methods supported by your configuration are listed in order of recommended usage.

|===

ANDU using System Manager is the recommended upgrade method for all patch upgrades regardless of configuration.  

[NOTE]
A xref:task_updating_an_ontap_cluster_disruptively.html[manual disruptive upgrade] can be performed on any configuration.  However, you should not perform a disruptive upgrade unless you can take the cluster offline for the duration of the upgrade. If you are operating in a SAN environment, you should be prepared to shut down or suspend all SAN clients before performing a disruptive upgrade. Disruptive upgrades are performed using the ONTAP CLI.
