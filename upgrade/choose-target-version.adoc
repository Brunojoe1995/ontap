You can choose your target ONTAP upgrade release based on the NetApp recommendation, your need for certain features, or your need to be at the minimum recommended release for performance.

* Upgrade to the latest available release (Recommended)
+
NetApp recommends that you upgrade your ONTAP software to the latest patch version of the latest numbered ONTAP release.  If this is not possible because the latest numbered release is not supported by the nodes in your cluster, you should upgrade to the latest numbered release that is supported.
+
* Feature availability
+
If you want to upgrade to the minimum ONTAP release required to support a specific feature, see link:https://www.netapp.com/media/15984-ontap-release-recommendation-guide.pdf[ONTAP release recommendations^] to determine the ONTAP version you should upgrade to.
+
* Minimum recommended release
+
If you want to restrict your upgrade to the minimum recommended release for your cluster, see link:https://kb.netapp.com/Support_Bulletins/Customer_Bulletins/SU2[Minimum Recommended ONTAP releases^] to determine the ONTAP version you should upgrade to.
