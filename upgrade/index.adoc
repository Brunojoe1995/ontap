When you upgrade your ONTAP software, you can take advantage of new and enhanced features and functionality that can help you reduce costs, accelerate critical workloads, and expand the scope of data protection available to your organization. 

A major ONTAP upgrade consists of moving from a lower to higher ONTAP numbered release. An example would be an upgrade of your cluster from ONTAP 9.8 to ONTAP 9.12.1.  A minor (or patch) upgrade consists of moving from a lower ONTAP version to a higher ONTAP version within the same numbered release. An example would be an upgrade of your cluster from ONTAP 9.12.1P1 to 9.12.1P4. 

Before you upgrade, you should link:prepare.html[prepare for the upgrade]. If you have an active SupportEdge contract for Active IQ Digital Advisor, link:create-upgrade-plan.html#plan-your-upgrade-with-upgrade-advisor[plan your upgrade with Upgrade Advisor]. Upgrade Advisor provides intelligence that helps you minimize uncertainty and risk by assessing your cluster and creating an upgrade plan specific to your configuration. 

After you prepare for your upgrade, it is recommended that you perform your major or minor upgrade using link:task_upgrade_andu_sm.html[Automated Non-Disruptive Upgrade (ANDU) from with System Manager].  ANDU takes advantage of ONTAPâ€™s high-availability (HA) failover technology to ensure that clusters continue to serve data without interruption during the upgrade. 

[NOTE]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, System Manager is fully integrated with BlueXP. If BlueXP is configured on your system, you can upgrade through the BlueXP working environment.

If you want assistance upgrading your ONTAP software, a link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/19393-netapp-managed-upgrade-service-description.pdf[Managed Upgrade] is offered through NetApp Professional Services.
