[.lead]
Before you upgrade ONTAP, if SSL FIPS mode is enabled on a cluster where administrator accounts authenticate with an SSH public key, you must ensure that the host key algorithm is supported on the target release.

include::_include/supported-ssh-key-types.adoc[]

Existing SSH public key accounts without the supported key algorithms must be reconfigured with a supported key type before enabling upgrading, or administrator authentication will fail.
