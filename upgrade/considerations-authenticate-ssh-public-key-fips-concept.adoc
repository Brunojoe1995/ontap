If SSL FIPS mode is enabled on a cluster where administrator accounts authenticate with an SSH public key, you must ensure that the host key algorithm is supported on the target release before upgrading ONTAP.

*Note:* Host key algorithm support has changed in ONTAP 9.11.1 and later releases.

|===

Existing SSH public key accounts without the supported key algorithms must be reconfigured with a supported key type before enabling upgrading, or administrator authentication will fail.
