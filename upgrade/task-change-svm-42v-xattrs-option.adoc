If you are using NFSv4.2 with an SVM created using ONTAP 9.11.1 or earlier, before you upgrade to ONTAP 9.12.1 and later you need to give an explicit value for the NFSv4.2 extended attributes option to prevent NFS response errors.

If the `v4.2-xattrs` option is never explicitly assigned a value before the ONTAP upgrade to 9.12.1 or later, NFSv4.2 clients are not informed that the server's extended attributes option has changed. This causes NFS response errors to specific `xattrs` calls due to a client and server mismatch.

.Before you begin

You must be running ONTAP 9.12.1 or later to set the value using the command described in this procedure.
