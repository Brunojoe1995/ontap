If you have an NFSv4.2 client, before you upgrade to ONTAP 9.12.1 and later you need to give an explicit value for the NFSv4.2 extended attributes option to prevent NFS response errors.

If the `v4.2-xattrs` option is never explicitly assigned a value before the ONTAP upgrade to 9.12.1 or later, NFSv4.2 clients are not informed that the server's extended attributes option has changed. This causes NFS response errors to specific `xattrs` calls due to a client and server mismatch.

.Steps

. Do one of the following:

* Assign an explicit value to the `v4.2-xattrs` option: 
+
[source,cli]
----
nfs modify -v4.2-xattrs <enabled/disabled> -vserver <vserver_name>
----

* Mount the volume using NFSv4, NFSv4.1, or NFSv3, which do not use extended attributes.
