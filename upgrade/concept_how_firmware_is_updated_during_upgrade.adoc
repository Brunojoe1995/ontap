You do not need to manually update your firmware prior to an ONTAP upgrade.  The firmware for your cluster is included with the ONTAP upgrade package and is copied to each node's boot device.  The new firmware is then installed as part of the upgrade process. 

Firmware for the following components is updated automatically if the version in your cluster is older than the firmware that is bundled with the ONTAP upgrade package:

* BIOS/LOADER
* Service Processor (SP) or baseboard management controller (BMC)
* Storage shelf
* Disk
* Flash Cache

To prepare for a smooth update, you should reboot the SP or BMC before the upgrade begins.

.Step

. Reboot the SP or BMC prior to the upgrade: `system service-processor reboot-sp -node node_name`
