[.lead]
Before you upgrade from ONTAP 8.3, you should move all of the load-sharing mirror source volumes to an aggregate on the node that you will upgrade last. This ensures that load-sharing mirror destination volumes are the same or later versions of ONTAP.

NOTE: You only need to perform this procedure when upgrading from ONTAP 8.3.

.Steps

. Record the locations of all load-sharing mirror source volumes.
+
Knowing where the load-sharing mirror source volumes came from helps facilitate returning them to their original locations after the major upgrade.

. Determine the node and aggregate to which you will move the load-sharing mirror source volumes.
. Move the load-sharing mirror source volumes to the node and aggregate by using the volume move start command.
