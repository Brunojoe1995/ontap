[.lead]
Before you upgrade, you must verify that any deduplicated volumes and the aggregates that contain them have sufficient free space for the deduplication metadata. If there is insufficient free space, deduplication will be disabled when the ONTAP upgrade is completed.

Each deduplicated volume must contain at least 4% free space. Each aggregate that contains a deduplicated volume must contain at least 3% free space.

.Steps

. Determine which volumes are deduplicated:
+
[source,cli]
----
volume efficiency show
----

. Determine the free space available on each volume that you identified: 
+
[source,cli]
----
vol show -vserver Vserver_name -volume volume_name -fields volume, size, used, available, percent-used, junction-path
----
+
Each deduplicated volume must not contain more than 96% used capacity. If necessary, you can increase the sizes of any volumes that exceed this capacity.
+

+
In this example, the percent-used field displays the percentage of used space on the deduplicated volume.:
+
----
vserver    volume size    junction-path available used   percent-used
----------- ------ ------- -------------
cluster1-01 vol0   22.99GB -             14.11GB      7.73GB 35%
cluster1-02 vol0   22.99GB -             12.97GB      8.87GB    40%

. Identify the free space available on each aggregate that contains a deduplicated volume: 
+
[source,cli]
----
aggr show -aggregate aggregate_name -fields aggregate, size, usedsize, availsize, percent-used
----
+
Each aggregate must not contain more than 97% used capacity. If necessary, you can increase the sizes of any aggregates that exceed this capacity.
+
link:../disks-aggregates/index.html[Disk and aggregate management]
+
In this example, the percent-used field displays the percentage of used space on the aggregate containing the deduplicated volume (aggr_2):
+
----
aggr show -aggregate aggregate_name -fields aggregate,size,usedsize,availsize,percent-used
aggregate         availsize percent-used size    usedsize
----------------- --------- ------------    ------- --------
aggr0_cluster1_01    1.11GB    95%          24.30GB 23.19GB
aggr0_cluster1_02 1022MB    96%          24.30GB    23.30GB
