It is a best practice to use Upgrade Advisor in link:https://aiq.netapp.com/[Active IQ Digital Advisor^] to plan your upgrade. 

[NOTE]
If you do not have an active link:https://www.netapp.com/us/services/support-edge.aspx[SupportEdge Services] contract for Active IQ, you should create your own upgrade plan.


== Plan your upgrade with Upgrade Advisor

The Upgrade Advisor service in Active IQ Digital Advisor provides intelligence that helps you plan your upgrade and minimizes uncertainty and risk.

Active IQ identifies issues in your environment that can be resolved by upgrading to a newer version of ONTAP. The Upgrade Advisor service helps you plan for a successful upgrade and provides a report of issues you might need to be aware of in the ONTAP version you're upgrading to.

.Steps

. https://aiq.netapp.com/[Launch Active IQ^]

. In Active IQ link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/task_view_risk_and_take_action.html[view risks associated with your cluster and manually take corrective actions].
+
Risks included in the *SW Config Change*, *HW Config Change*, and *HW Replacement* categories must be resolved prior to performing an ONTAP upgrade.

. Review the recommended upgrade path and link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/task_view_upgrade.html[generate your upgrade plan^].

== How long will my upgrade take?

You should plan for at least 30 minutes to complete preparatory steps, 60 minutes to upgrade each HA pair, and at least 30 minutes to complete post-upgrade steps.

NOTE: If you are using NetApp Encryption with an external key management server and the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP), you should expect the upgrade for each HA pair to be longer than one hour. 

Our upgrade duration guidelines are based on typical configurations and workloads. You can use these guidelines to estimate the time it will take to perform a nondisruptive upgrade in your environment. However, the actual duration of your upgrade process will depend on your individual environment and the number of nodes.
