You don't have to be in the process of upgrading your ONTAP software to execute the ONTAP automated upgrade pre-checks.  Executing the pre-upgrade checks independently of the ONTAP automated upgrade process allows you to see which checks are performed against your cluster and gives you a list of any errors or warnings that should be corrected before you begin the actual upgrade.  For example, suppose you expect to upgrade your ONTAP software during a maintenance window scheduled to occur in two months.  While you are waiting for the scheduled date, you can run the automated upgrade pre-checks and take any necessary corrective actions in advance of your maintenance window.  This will mitigate risks of unexpected configuration errors after you start your upgrade.

If you are ready to begin your ONTAP software upgrade, you do  not need to perform this procedure.  You should follow the link:automated-upgrade-task.html[automated upgrade process], which includes execution of the automated upgrade pre-checks.

[NOTE]
For MetroCluster configurations, you should first execute these steps on Cluster A, then execute the same steps on Cluster B.

.Before you begin

You should link:download-software-image.html[download the target ONTAP software image].

To execute the automated upgrade pre-checks for a link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/upgrade/concept_upgrade_paths.html#types-of-upgrade-paths[direct multi-hop upgrade], you only need to download the software package for your target ONTAP version.  You won't need to load the intermediate ONTAP version until you begin the actual upgrade.  For example, if you are executing automated pre-upgrade checks for an upgrade from 9.8 to 9.13.1, you need to download the software package for ONTAP 9.13.1.  You don't need to download the software package for ONTAP 9.12.1.

. Validate the ONTAP target image: 
+
[NOTE]
If you are upgrading a MetroCluster configuration, you should validate Cluster A and then repeat the validation process on Cluster B.

.. Depending on the ONTAP version that you are running, perform one of the following steps:
+

|===

h|If you are running...  h| Do this...

| ONTAP 9.8 or later a| Click *Cluster > Overview*.
| ONTAP 9.5, 9.6, and 9.7 a| Click *Configuration* > *Cluster* > *Update*.
| ONTAP 9.4 or earlier a| Click *Configuration* > *Cluster Update*.
|===

.. In the right corner of the *Overview* pane, click image:icon_kabob.gif[menu icon].

.. Click *ONTAP Update*.

.. In the *Cluster Update* tab, add a new image or select an available image.
+

|===

h| If you want to... h| Then...

a|
Add a new software image from a local folder

You should have already link:download-software-image.html[downloaded the image] to the local client.

a|

... Under *Available Software Images*, click *Add from Local*.
... Browse to the location you saved the software image, select the image, and then click *Open*.


a|
Add a new software image from an HTTP or FTP server
a|

... Click *Add from Server*.
... In the *Add a New Software Image* dialog box, enter the URL of the HTTP or FTP server to which you downloaded the ONTAP software image from the NetApp Support Site.
+
For anonymous FTP, you must specify the URL in the ftp://anonymous@ftpserver format.

... Click *Add*.

a|
Select an available image
a|
Choose one of the listed images.
|===

.. Click *Validate* to run the pre-upgrade validation checks.
+
If any errors or warnings are found during validation, they are displayed along with a list of corrective actions. You must resolve all errors before proceeding with the upgrade.  It is best practice to also resolve warnings.

.CLI

--

. Load the target ONTAP software image into the cluster package repository:
+
[source, cli]
----
cluster image package get -url location
----
+
----
cluster1::> cluster image package get -url http://www.example.com/software/9.13.1/image.tgz

Package download completed.
Package processing completed.
----


. Verify that the software package is available in the cluster package repository:
+
[source, cli]
----
cluster image package show-repository
----
+
----
cluster1::> cluster image package show-repository
Package Version  Package Build Time
---------------- ------------------
9.13.1              MM/DD/YYYY 10:32:15
----

. Execute the automated pre-upgrade checks:
+
[source, cli]
----
cluster image validate -version package_version_number
----
+
* If you are performing a link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/upgrade/concept_upgrade_paths.html#types-of-upgrade-paths[direct multi-hop upgrade],use the target ONTAP package for verification.  You don't need to validate the intermediate upgrade image separately.  For example, if you are upgrading from 9.8 to 9.13.1, you should use the 9.13.1 package for verification. You don't need to validate the 9.12.1 package separately.
+
----
cluster1::> cluster image validate -version 9.13.1

WARNING: There are additional manual upgrade validation checks that must be performed after these automated validation checks have completed...

----
. Monitor the progress of the validation:
+
[source, cli]
----
cluster image show-update-progress
----
+
A list of complete automated upgrade pre-checks is displayed along with any errors or warnings that should be addressed before you begin the upgrade process.
