The version of ONTAP that you can upgrade to varies based on your hardware platform and the version of ONTAP currently running on your nodes.  See https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe] to verify that your platform is supported for upgrade.

To determine the your current ONTAP version:

* In System Manager, click *Cluster > Overview*.
* From the command line interface (CLI), you use the `system image show` command.

If you are planning an ONTAP upgrade from an older ONTAP version (such as 9.3), it is a best practice to upgrade first to the latest patch release in the same ONTAP release family and only then upgrade to the next supported major release. This will ensure that any issues in the older version are resolved before upgrading.

For example, if your system is running ONTAP 9.3P9 and you are planning to upgrade 
to 9.9.1, the following is the recommended path:
    9.3P9 -> 9.3P21 -> 9.7 -> 9.9.1
In all major ONTAP versions, use the latest available patch release.

a| ONTAP 9.10.0
a| ONTAP 9.10.1

a| ONTAP 9.9.1
a| ONTAP 9.10.0, 9.10.1

a| ONTAP 9.9.0

a| ONTAP 9.6
a| ONTAP 9.7 or 9.8

a| ONTAP 9.5
a| ONTAP 9.6, 9.7, or 9.9.1

*Note:* If you are upgrading from ONTAP 9.5 directly to 9.9.1, you must download the software images for ONTAP 9.7 and 9.9.1. The automated upgrade process uses the 9.7 image in the background to complete the update to 9.9.1. You should expect multiple reboots during the process.

a| ONTAP 9.4
a| ONTAP 9.5

a| ONTAP 9.3
a| ONTAP 9.4, 9.5 or 9.7

*Note:* If you are upgrading from ONTAP 9.3 directly to 9.7, you must download the software images for ONTAP 9.5 and 9.7. The automated upgrade process uses the 9.5 image in the background to complete the update to 9.7. You should expect multiple reboots during the process.

a| ONTAP 9.2
a| ONTAP 9.3

a| ONTAP 9.1
a| ONTAP 9.2 or 9.3

a| ONTAP 9
a| ONTAP 9.1

a| Data ONTAP 8.3.x
a| ONTAP 9 or 9.1

a| Data ONTAP 8.2.x or earlier

*Note:* If you are running a release earlier than Data ONTAP 8.3.x, you cannot upgrade directly to ONTAP 9 or 9.1. You must upgrade to Data ONTAP 8.3.x first, then upgrade to ONTAP 9 or 9.1.
a| Data ONTAP 8.3.x
