The version of ONTAP that you can upgrade to varies based on your hardware platform and the version of ONTAP currently running on your nodes. See https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] to verify that your platform is supported for the target upgrade release.

*Note:* These guidelines refer only to on-premises ONTAP releases. For information about upgrading cloud-only releases, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_updating_ontap_cloud.html[Upgrading Cloud Volumes ONTAP software^].

To determine your current ONTAP version:

* In System Manager, click *Cluster > Overview*.
* From the command line interface (CLI), use the `system image show` command.

If you are planning an ONTAP upgrade from an older ONTAP version (such as 9.3), it is a best practice to upgrade first to the latest patch release in the same ONTAP release family and only then upgrade to the next supported major release. This will ensure that any issues in the older version are resolved before upgrading.

For example, if your system is running ONTAP 9.3P9 and you are planning to upgrade to 9.9.1, follow this upgrade path:
    9.3P9 -> 9.3P21 -> 9.7 -> 9.9.1
In all major ONTAP versions, use the latest available patch release.

[[ontap9_paths]]
== Upgrade paths within the ONTAP 9 release family

The following table lists all supported upgrade paths. Automatic and manual nondistruptive upgrade methods can be used for all paths except for certain system configurations that require disruptive upgrades and as noted in the table. Upgrade images for some earlier releases are no longer available.

== Upgrade paths from Data ONTAP 8.* releases to ONTAP 9 releases

Be sure to verify that your platform can run the target ONTAP release by using the See NetApp Hardware Universe.

Note: Data ONTAP 8.3 Upgrade Guide erroneously states that [epsilon, 4-node]. This is no longer a requirement for upgrades beginning with Data ONTAP 8.2.

From Data ONTAP 8.3.x::
You can upgrade directly to ONTAP 9.1, then upgrade to later releases as described in <<ontap9_paths>>.

From Data ONTAP releases earlier than 8.3.x, including 8.2.x::
You must first upgrade to Data ONTAP 8.3.x, then upgrade to ONTAP 9.1, then upgrade to later releases as described in <<ontap9_paths>>.
