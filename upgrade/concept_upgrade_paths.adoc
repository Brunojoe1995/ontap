The version of ONTAP that you can upgrade to varies based on your hardware platform and the version of ONTAP currently running on your nodes.  See https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe] to verify that your platform is supported for upgrade.

To determine the your current ONTAP version:

* In System Manager, click *Cluster > Overview*.
* From the command line interface (CLI), you use the `system image show` command.
