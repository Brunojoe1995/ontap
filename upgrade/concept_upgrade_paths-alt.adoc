The version of ONTAP that you can upgrade to varies based on your hardware platform and the version of ONTAP currently running on your cluster's nodes. See https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] to verify that your platform is supported for the target upgrade release.

*Note:* These guidelines refer only to on-premises ONTAP releases. For information about upgrading ONTAP in the cloud, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_updating_ontap_cloud.html[Upgrading Cloud Volumes ONTAP software^].

To determine your current ONTAP version:

* In System Manager, click *Cluster > Overview*.
* From the command line interface (CLI), use the `cluster image show` command. +
You can also use the `system node image show` command in the advanced privilege level to display details.

== Types of upgrade paths

Automated nondisruptive upgrades (ANDU) are recommended whenever possible. Depending on your current and target releases, your upgrade path will be _direct_, _direct multi-hop_, or _multi-stage_. Unless otherwise noted, these paths apply to all link:concept_upgrade_methods.html[upgrade methods]; nondisruptive or disruptive, automated or manual.

*	_direct_ +
You can always upgrade directly to the next adjacent ONTAP release family using a single software image. For most releases, you can also install a software image that allows you to upgrade directly to releases that are two releases higher than the running release.
+
For example, you can use the direct update path from 9.8 to 9.9.1, or from 9.8 to 9.10.1.
+
*Note:* Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, software images support upgrading directly to releases that are three releases higher than the running release. For example, you can use the direct upgrade path from 9.8 to 9.11.1.

*	_direct multi-hop_ +
For some automated nondisruptive upgrades (ANDU) to non-adjacent releases, you can install the software image for an intermediate release as well the target release. The automated upgrade process uses the intermediate image in the background to complete the update to the target release.
+
For example, if the cluster is running 9.3 and you want to upgrade to 9.7, you would load the ONTAP install packages for both 9.5 and 9.7, then initiate ANDU to 9.7. ONTAP then automatically upgrades the cluster first to 9.5 and then to 9.7. You should expect multiple takeover/giveback operations and related reboots during the process.
+
The following direct multi-hop upgrade paths are available using the ANDU method:
+

|Source ONTAP release |Target ONTAP release |Images required

|9.11.1
|9.8, 9.11.1

.2+|9.3
|9.7
|9.5, 9.7

|9.6
|9.5, 9.6

|===
* _multi-stage_ +
If a direct or direct multi-hop path is not available for your non-adjacent target release, you must first upgrade to a supported intermediate release, and then upgrade to the target release.
+
For example, if you are currently running 9.7 and you want to upgrade to 9.11.1, you must complete a multi-stage upgrade: first from 9.7 to 9.9.1, and then from 9.9.1 to 9.11.1. Upgrades from earlier releases might require three or more stages, with several intermediate upgrades.
+
*Note:* Before beginning multi-stage upgrades, be sure your target release is supported on your hardware platform.

If you are planning an ONTAP upgrade from an older ONTAP version (such as 9.3), it is a best practice to upgrade first to the latest patch release in the same ONTAP release family and only then upgrade to the next supported major release. This will ensure that any issues in the older version are resolved before upgrading.

For example, if your system is running ONTAP 9.3P9 and you are planning to upgrade to 9.9.1, follow this upgrade path:
     9.3P9 -> 9.3P21 -> 9.7 -> 9.9.1
In all major ONTAP versions, use the latest available patch release.

[[ontap9_paths_alt]]
== Supported upgrade paths

* Automated nondisruptive upgrade (ANDU) paths within the ONTAP 9 release family (recommended)
* Manual nondisruptive and disruptive upgrade paths within the ONTAP 9 release family
* Upgrade paths from Data ONTAP 8.* releases to ONTAP 9 releases

.Data ONTAP 8 upgrade paths
--
Be sure to verify that your platform can run the target ONTAP release by using the See NetApp Hardware Universe.

*Note:* Data ONTAP 8.3 Upgrade Guide erroneously states that in a four-node cluster, you should plan to upgrade the node that holds epsilon last. This is no longer a requirement for upgrades beginning with Data ONTAP 8.2.3. For more information, see https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/805277[NetApp Bugs Online Bug ID 805277^].

From Data ONTAP 8.3.x::
You can upgrade directly to ONTAP 9.1, then upgrade to later releases as described in <<ontap9_paths_alt>>.

From Data ONTAP releases earlier than 8.3.x, including 8.2.x::
You must first upgrade to Data ONTAP 8.3.x, then upgrade to ONTAP 9.1, then upgrade to later releases as described in <<ontap9_paths_alt>>.
