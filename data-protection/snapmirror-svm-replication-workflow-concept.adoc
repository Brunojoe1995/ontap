SnapMirror SVM replication involves creating the destination SVM, creating a replication job schedule, and creating and initializing a SnapMirror relationship.

You should determine which replication workflow best suits your needs:

* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/data-protection/replicate-entire-svm-config-task.html[Replicate an entire SVM configuration]
* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/data-protection/exclude-lifs-svm-replication-task.html[Exclude LIFs and related network settings from SVM replication]
* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/data-protection/exclude-network-name-service-svm-replication-task.html[Exlude network, name service, and other settings from SVM configuration]

//[NOTE]
//====
//This workflow assumes that you are already using a default policy or a custom replication policy.
