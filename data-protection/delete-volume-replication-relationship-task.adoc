You can use the `snapmirror delete` and `snapmirror release` commands to delete a volume replication relationship. You can then delete unneeded destination volumes manually.

.About this task

The `snapmirror release` command deletes any SnapMirror-created Snapshot copies from the source. You can use the `-relationship-info-only` option to preserve the Snapshot copies.

.Steps

. If you have SnapMirror Synchronous relationships (supported beginning with ONTAP 9.5), quiesce the replication relationship:
+
`snapmirror quiesce -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_`
+
----
cluster_src::> snapmirror quiesce -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----

. Delete the replication relationship:
+
`snapmirror delete -source-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ... -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ...`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must run this command from the destination cluster or destination SVM.
====
+
The following example deletes the relationship between the source volume `volA` on `svm1` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror delete -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----

. Release replication relationship information from the source SVM:
+
`snapmirror release -source-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ... -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ...`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must run this command from the source cluster or source SVM.
====
+
The following example releases information for the specified replication relationship from the source SVM `svm1`:
+
----
cluster_src::> snapmirror release -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
