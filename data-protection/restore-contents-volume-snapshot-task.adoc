[.lead]
You can use the `volume snapshot restore` command to restore the contents of a volume from a Snapshot copy.

.About this task

If the volume has SnapMirror relationships, manually replicate all mirror copies of the volume immediately after you restore from a Snapshot copy. Not doing so can result in unusable mirror copies that must be deleted and recreated.
