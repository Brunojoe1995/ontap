If a root volume is permanently unavailable, you can promote the load-sharing mirror (LSM) volume to provide write access to root volume data.

.What you'll need

You must use advanced privilege level commands for this task.

.Steps

. Change to advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Promote an LSM volume:
+
`snapmirror promote -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example promotes the volume `svm1_m2` as the new SVM root volume:
+
----
cluster_src::*> snapmirror promote -destination-path svm1:svm1_m2

Warning: Promote will delete the offline read-write volume
         cluster_src://svm1/svm1_root and replace it with
         cluster_src://svm1/svm1_m2. Because the volume is offline,
         it is not possible to determine whether this promote will
         affect other relationships associated with this source.
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
----
+
Enter `y`. ONTAP makes the LSM volume a read/write volume, and deletes the original root volume if it is accessible.
+
[NOTE]
====
The promoted root volume might not have all of the data that was in the original root volume if the last update did not occur recently.
====

. Return to admin privilege level:
+
`set -privilege admin`
. Rename the promoted volume following the naming convention you used for the root volume:
+
`volume rename -vserver _SVM_ -volume _volume_ -newname _new_name_`
+
The following example renames the promoted volume `svm1_m2` with the name `svm1_root`:
+
----
cluster_src::> volume rename -vserver svm11 -volume svm1_m2 -newname svm1_root
----

. Protect the renamed root volume, as described in step 3 through step 4 in link:create-load-sharing-mirror-task.html[Creating and initializing load-sharing mirror relationships].
