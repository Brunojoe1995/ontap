Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, SnapMirror Cloud provides asynchronous snapshot replication from ONTAP to object storage endpoints. SnapMirror Cloud relationships can only be configured using pre-qualified third-party backup applications. To configure ONTAP to object storage replication, both SnapMirror and SnapMirror Cloud licenses are required on the ONTAP source cluster configured for replication to the object store endpoint.

.About this task

The SnapMirror Cloud API license is a single-instance cluster-wide license, which means it does not need to be installed on every node in the cluster. In addition to this end user license, SnapMirror Cloud requires an authorized and approved backup application to configure and invoke ONTAP APIs for replication. Both SnapMirror Cloud end user license and an authorized app are necessary to utilize SnapMirror Cloud replication.

Clusters that have the ONTAP One software suite are entitled to the SnapMirror Cloud license free of charge; however, because the license is a cluster-wide license and not node-based like other feature licenses, you must request the separate ONTAP One compatibility bundle, which includes the SnapMirror Cloud license as well as the S3 API license. 

You use System Manager to install a SnapMirror Cloud API license on the cluster.

.Steps

. Request the NetApp License Files (NLFs) for SnapMirror Cloud from the NetApp Support Site and follow the instructions provided on the site.

. When you receive the license key, use System Manager to upload the SnapMirror Cloud NLF to the cluster:
 .. Click *Cluster > Settings*. 
 .. In the *Settings* window, click *Licenses*.
 .. In the *Licenses* window, click image:icon_add.gif[add icon].
 .. In the *Add License* dialog box, click *Browse* to select the NLF you downloaded, and then click *Add* to upload the file to the cluster.
