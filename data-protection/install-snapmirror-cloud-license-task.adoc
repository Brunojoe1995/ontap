Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can use System Manager to orchestrate SnapMirror Cloud replication. SnapMirror Cloud relationships can only be configured using pre-qualified third-party backup applications. Before you can use System Manager to orchestrate on-premises ONTAP to object storage backups, you need to request and install the SnapMirror Cloud license and the S3 SnapMirror license, as well as a separate SnapMirror API license. 

The SnapMirror Cloud and S3 SnapMirror licenses are cluster licenses, not node licenses, so they are _not_ delivered with the ONTAP One license bundle. These licenses are included in the separate ONTAP Cloud Compatibility bundle. If you want to enable SnapMirror Cloud, you need to request this bundle. 

Additionally, you need to request the SnapMirror Cloud API license. The SnapMirror Cloud API license is a single-instance cluster-wide license, meaning it does not need to be installed on every node in the cluster. In addition to this license, SnapMirror Cloud requires an authorized and approved backup application to configure and invoke ONTAP APIs for replication. Both SnapMirror Cloud end user license and an authorized app are necessary to utilize SnapMirror Cloud replication. 

.Steps

You can request and download the SnapMirror Cloud Compatibility bundle and the SnapMirror Cloud API license and then install them using System Manager.
