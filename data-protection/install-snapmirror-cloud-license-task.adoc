SnapMirror Cloud relationships can be orchestrated using pre-qualified third-party backup applications. Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can also use System Manager to orchestrate SnapMirror Cloud replication. Both SnapMirror and SnapMirror Cloud capacity licenses are required when using System Manager to orchestrate on-premises ONTAP to object storage backups. You will also need to request and install the SnapMirror Cloud API license.

.About this task

The SnapMirror Cloud and S3 SnapMirror licenses are cluster licenses, not node licenses, so they are _not_ delivered with the ONTAP One license bundle. These licenses are included in the separate ONTAP One Compatibility bundle. If you want to enable SnapMirror Cloud, you need to request this bundle. 

Additionally, System Manager orchestration of SnapMirror Cloud backups to object storage requires a SnapMirror Cloud API key. This API license is a single-instance cluster-wide license, meaning it does not need to be installed on every node in the cluster.

.Steps

You need to request and download the ONTAP One Compatibility bundle and the SnapMirror Cloud API license and then install them using System Manager.


. Locate and record the cluster UUID for the cluster you want to license. 
+
The cluster UUID is required when you submit your request to order the ONTAP One Compatibility bundle for your cluster. 
. Contact your NetApp sales team and request the ONTAP One Compatibility bundle.
. Request the SnapMirror Cloud API license by following the instructions provided on the NetApp Support Site.

. When you've received and downloaded the license files, use System Manager to upload the ONTAP Cloud Compatibility NLF and the SnapMirror Cloud API NLF to the cluster:
 .. Click *Cluster > Settings*. 
 .. In the *Settings* window, click *Licenses*.
 .. In the *Licenses* window, click image:icon_add.gif[add icon].
 .. In the *Add License* dialog box, click *Browse* to select the NLF you downloaded, and then click *Add* to upload the file to the cluster.
