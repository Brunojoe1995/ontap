A Snapshot policy specifies when to create Snapshot copies, how many copies to retain, and how to name them. For example, a system might create one Snapshot copy every day at 12:10 a.m., retain the two most recent copies, and name them "`daily.`_timestamp_`.`" A Snapshot policy can contain up to five job schedules.

.About this task

By default, ONTAP forms the names of Snapshot copies by appending a timestamp to the job schedule name:

----
daily.2017-05-14_0013/              hourly.2017-05-15_1106/
daily.2017-05-15_0012/              hourly.2017-05-15_1206/
hourly.2017-05-15_1006/             hourly.2017-05-15_1306/
----

You can substitute a prefix for the job schedule name if you prefer.

The `snapmirror-label` option is for SnapMirror replication. For more information, see link:define-rule-policy-task.html[Defining a rule for a policy].

.Step

. Create a Snapshot policy:
+
`volume snapshot policy create -vserver _SVM_ -policy _policy_name_ -enabled true|false -schedule1 _schedule1_name_ -count1 _copies_to_retain_ -prefix1 _snapshot_prefix_ -snapmirror-label1 _snapshot_label_ ... -schedule5 _schedule5_name_ -count5 _copies_to_retain_-prefix5 _snapshot_prefix_ -snapmirror-label5 _snapshot_label_`
+
The following example creates a Snapshot policy named `snap_policy_daily` that runs on a `daily` schedule. The policy has a maximum of five Snapshot copies, each with the name `daily`.`_timestamp_` and the SnapMirror label `daily`:
