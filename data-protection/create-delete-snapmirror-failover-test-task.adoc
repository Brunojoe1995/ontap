Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can use System Manager to create a volume clone to test SnapMirror failover and disaster recovery without disrupting the active SnapMIrror relationship. When you finish testing, you can clean up the associated data and delete the test volume.

== Create a SnapMirror failover test volume

.About this task

* You can perform failover tests on synchronous and asynchronous SnapMirror relationships.
* A volume clone is created to perform the disaster recovery test.
* The clone volume is created on the same storage VM as the SnapMirror destination.
* You can use FlexVol and FlexGroup SnapMirror relationships.
* If a test clone already exists for the selected relationship, you cannot create another clone for that relationship.
* SnapLock vault relationships are not supported.

.Before you begin

* You must be a cluster administrator.
* The SnapMirror license must be installed on the source and destination cluster.

.Steps

. Select *Protection > Relationships*. 
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[alt=Menu Options] next to the relationship source and choose *Test Failover*.
