You can reestablish the original data protection relationship between the source and destination volumes when you no longer need to serve data from the destination.

.About this task

* The procedure below assumes that the baseline in the original source volume is intact. If the baseline is not intact, you must create and initialize the relationship between the volume you are serving data from and the original source volume before performing the procedure.
* Background preparation and the data warehousing phase of an XDP SnapMirror relationship can take a long time. It is not uncommon to see the SnapMirror relationship reporting the status "preparing" for an extended time period.

.Steps

. Delete the original data protection relationship:
+
`snapmirror delete -source-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ... -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ...`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
You must run this command from the destination SVM or the destination cluster.
+
The following example deletes the relationship between the original source volume, `volA` on `svm1`, and the volume you are serving data from, `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror delete -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----

. Reverse the original data protection relationship:
+
`snapmirror resync -source-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ... -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ...`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
You must run this command from the destination SVM or the destination cluster. Although resync does not require a baseline transfer, it can be time-consuming. You might want to run the resync in off-peak hours.
+
The following example reverses the relationship between the original source volume, `volA` on `svm1`, and the volume you are serving data from, `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror resync -source-path svm_backup:volA_dst -destination-path svm1:volA
----

. Stop the source SVM for the reversed relationship:
+
`vserver stop -vserver _SVM_`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example stops the source SVM for the reversed relationship:
+
----
cluster_src::> vserver stop svm_backup
----

. Update the reversed relationship:
+
`snapmirror update -source-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ... -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ...`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must run this command from the destination SVM or the destination cluster.The command fails if a common Snapshot copy does not exist on the source and destination. Use `snapmirror initialize` to re-initialize the relationship.
====
+
The following example updates the relationship between the volume you are serving data from, `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`, and the original source volume, `volA` on `svm1`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror update -source-path svm_backup:volA_dst -destination-path svm1:volA
----

. Stop scheduled transfers for the reversed relationship:
+
`snapmirror quiesce -source-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ... -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ...`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+

You must run this command from the destination SVM or the destination cluster.
====
+
The following example stops scheduled transfers between the volume you are serving data from, `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`, and the original source volume, `volA` on `svm1`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror quiesce -source-path svm_backup:volA_dst -destination-path svm1:volA
----

. Stop ongoing transfers for the reversed relationship:
+
`snapmirror abort -source-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ... -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ...`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.

+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror abort -source-path svm_backup:volA_dst -destination-path svm1:volA
----

. Break the reversed relationship:
+
`snapmirror break -source-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ... -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ...`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must run this command from the destination SVM or the destination cluster.
====
+
The following example breaks the relationship between the volume you are serving data from, `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`, and the original source volume, `volA` on `svm1`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror break -source-path svm_backup:volA_dst -destination-path svm1:volA
----

. Start the original source SVM:
+
`vserver start -vserver _SVM_`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example starts the original source SVM:
+
----
cluster_dst::> vserver start svm1
----

. Delete the reversed data protection relationship:
+
`snapmirror delete -source-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ... -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ...`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
You must run this command from the source SVM or the source cluster for the reversed relationship.
+
The following example deletes the reversed relationship between the original source volume, `volA` on `svm1`, and the volume you are serving data from, `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_src::> snapmirror delete -source-path svm_backup:volA_dst -destination-path svm1:volA
----

. Reestablish the original data protection relationship:
+
`snapmirror resync -source-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ... -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ...`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example reestablishes the relationship between the original source volume, `volA` on `svm1`, and the original destination volume, `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror resync -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----

.After you finish

Use the `snapmirror show` command to verify that the SnapMirror relationship was created. For complete command syntax, see the man page.
