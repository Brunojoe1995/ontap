= Make the destination volume writeable
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
You need to make the destination volume writeable before you can serve data from the volume to clients. You can use the `snapmirror quiesce` command to stop scheduled transfers to the destination, the `snapmirror abort` command to stop ongoing transfers, and the `snapmirror break` command to make the destination writeable.

.About this task

You must perform this task from the destination SVM or the destination cluster.

.Steps
To serve data from a mirror destination when a source becomes unavailable, stop scheduled transfers to the destination, and then break the SnapMirror relationship to make the destination writable.

. Select the desired protection relationship: click *Protection > Relationships*, and then click the desired volume name.

. Click image:icon_kabob.gif[More options].

. Stop scheduled transfers : click *Pause*.

. Make the destination writable: click *Break*.

. Go to the main *Relationships* page to verify that the relationship state displays as "broken off".

.Next steps:

When the disabled source volume is available again, you should resynchronize the relationship to copy the current data to the original source volume. This process replaces the data on the original source volume.

. Stop scheduled transfers to the destination:
+
[source,cli]
----
snapmirror quiesce -source-path <SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume> -destination-path <SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume>
----
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example stops scheduled transfers between the source volume `volA` on `svm1` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror quiesce -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----

. Stop ongoing transfers to the destination:
+
[source,cli]
----
snapmirror abort -source-path <SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume> -destination-path <SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume>
----
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
[NOTE]
This step is not required for SnapMirror Synchronous relationships (supported beginning with ONTAP 9.5).
+
The following example stops ongoing transfers between the source volume `volA` on `svm1` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror abort -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----

. Break the SnapMirror DR relationship:
+
[source,cli]
----
snapmirror break -source-path <SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume> -destination-path <SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume>
----
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example breaks the relationship between the source volume `volA` on `svm1` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror break -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
