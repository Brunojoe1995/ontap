[.lead]
You create multi-admin verification (MAV) rules to designate operations requiring approval. Whenever an operation is initiated, protected operations are intercepted and a request for approval is generated.

Rules can be created before enabling MAV by any administrator with appropriate RBAC capabilities, but once MAV is enabled, any modification to the rule set requires MAV approval.

== Rule-protected commands

You can create rules to protect the following commands beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1.

include::../_include/mav-ontap-9111-operations-to-protect.adoc[]

You can create rules to protect the following commands beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1:
//shared with mav index topic

* `volume snaplock modify`
* `security anti-ransomware volume attack clear-suspect`
* `security anti-ransomware volume disable`
* `security anti-ransomware volume pause`

You can create rules to protect the following commands beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1:

include::../_include/mav-ontap-9141-operations-to-protect.adoc[]

The rules for MAV system-default commands, the `security multi-admin-verify` link:../multi-admin-verify/index.html#system-defined-rules[commands], cannot be altered.

include::../_include/mav-ontap-default-protected-operations.adoc[]

When you create a rule, you can optionally specify the `-query` option to limit the request to a subset of the command functionality. For example, in the default set command, `-query` is set to `-privilege diag`, meaning that a request is generated for the set command only when `-privilege diag` is specified.

          Query: -privilege diagnostic
----
By default, rules specify that a corresponding `security multi-admin-verify request create _“protected_operation”_` command is generated automatically when a protected operation is entered. You can modify this default to require that the `request create` command be entered separately.

By default, rules inherit the following global MAV settings, although you can specify rule-specific exceptions:

* Required Number of Approvers
* Approval Groups
* Approval Expiry period
* Execution Expiry period

== System Manager procedure

If you want to add a protected operation rule for the first time, see the System Manager procedure to link:enable-disable-task.html#system-manager-procedure[enable multi-admin verification.]

To modify the existing rule set:

. Select *Cluster > Settings*.
. Select image:icon_gear.gif[gear icon] next to *Multi-Admin Approval* in the *Security* section.
. Select image:icon_add.gif[add icon] to add at least one rule; you can also modify or delete existing rules.
+
* Operation – Select a supported command from the list.
* Query – Enter any desired command options and values.
* Optional parameters – Leave blank to apply global settings, or assign a different value for specific rules to override the global settings.
** Required number of approvers
** Approval groups

== CLI procedure

NOTE: All `security multi-admin-verify rule` commands require MAV administrator approval before execution except `security multi-admin-verify rule show`.

| If you want to…
| Enter this command
| Create a rule a| `security multi-admin-verify rule create -operation _“protected_operation”_ [-query _operation_subset_] [_parameters_]`
| Modify credentials of current administrators a| `security login modify <parameters>`

*Example*: the following rule requires approval to delete the root volume.

`security multi-admin-verify rule create  -operation "volume delete" -query "-vserver vs0"`
| Modify a rule a| `security multi-admin-verify rule modify -operation _“protected_operation”_ [_parameters_]`
|Delete a rule a| `security multi-admin-verify rule delete -operation _“protected_operation”_`
| Show rules a| `security multi-admin-verify rule show`
