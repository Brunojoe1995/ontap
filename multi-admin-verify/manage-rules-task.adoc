[.lead]
You create multi-admin verification (MAV) rules to designate operations requiring approval. Whenever an operation is initiated, protected operations are intercepted and a request for approval is generated.

Rules can be created before enabling MAV by any administrator with appropriate RBAC capabilities, but once MAV is enabled, any modification to the rule set requires MAV approval.

You can create rules for the following commands beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1.

a|
`cluster peer delete`

`event config modify`

`security login create`

`security login delete`

`security login modify`

`system node run`

`system node systemshell`

`volume delete`

`volume flexcache delete`
a|
`volume snapshot autodelete modify`

`volume snapshot delete`

`volume snapshot policy add-schedule`

`volume snapshot policy create`

`volume snapshot policy delete`

`volume snapshot policy modify`

`volume snapshot policy modify-schedule`

`volume snapshot policy remove-schedule`

`volume snapshot restore`

`vserver peer delete`
|===

You can create rules for the following command beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1:

* `volume snaplock modify`

In addition, the following commands are protected by default when MAV is enabled, but you can modify the rules to remove protection for these commands.

* `security login password`
* `security login unlock`
* `set`

The rules for MAV system-default commands – the `security multi-admin-verify` commands – cannot be altered.

When you create a rule, you can optionally specify the `-query` option to limit the request to a subset of the command functionality. For example, in the default set command, `-query` is set to `-privilege diag`, meaning that a request is generated for the set command only when -privilege diag is specified.

----
By default, rules specify that a corresponding `security multi-admin-verify request create _“protected_operation”_` command is generated automatically when a protected operation is entered. You can modify this default to require that the `request create` command be entered separate.

By default, rules inherit the following global MAV settings, although you can specify rule-specific exceptions:

* Required Number of Approvers
* Approval Groups
* Approval Expiry period
* Execution Expiry period

== System Manager procedure

If you want to add a protected operation rule for the first time, see the System Manager procedure to link:enable-disable-task.html#system-manager-procedure[enable multi-admin verification.]

To modify the existing rule set:

. Click *Cluster > Settings*.
. Click image:icon_gear.gif[gear icon] next to *Multi-Admin Approval* in the *Security* section.
. Click image:icon_add.gif[add icon] to add at least one rule; you can also modify or delete existing rules.
+
* Operation – Select a supported command from the list.
* Query – Enter any desired command options and values.
* Optional parameters – Leave blank to apply global settings, or assign a different value for specific rules to override the global settings.
** Required number of approvers
** Approval groups

== CLI procedure

NOTE: All `security multi-admin-verify rule` commands require MAV administrator approval before execution except `security multi-admin-verify rule show`.

| If you want to…
| Enter this command
| Create a rule a| `security multi-admin-verify rule create -operation _“protected_operation”_ [-query _operation_subset_] [_parameters_]`
| Modify credentials of current administrators a| `security login modify _<parameters>_`

*Example*: the following rule requires approval to delete the root volume.

`security multi-admin-verify rule create  -operation "volume delete" -query "-vserver vs0`
| Modify a rule a| `security multi-admin-verify rule modify -operation _“protected_operation”_ [_parameters_]`
|Delete a rule a| `security multi-admin-verify rule delete -operation _“protected_operation”_`
| Show rules a| `security multi-admin-verify rule show`
