[.lead]
As a security best practice, Telnet and RSH are disabled by default. To enable the cluster to accept Telnet or RSH requests, you must enable the service in the default management service policy.

.About this task

* RSH is not a secure protocol.
+
You should consider using SSH to access the cluster. SSH provides a secure remote shell and interactive network session.

* ONTAP supports a maximum of 50 concurrent RSH sessions per node.
+
If the cluster management LIF resides on the node, it shares this limit with the node management LIF.
+
If the rate of incoming connections is higher than 10 per second, the service is temporarily disabled for 60 seconds.

* RSH commands require advanced privileges.

.Steps

. Confirm that the RSH or Telnet security protocol is enabled:
+
`security protocol show`

.. If the RSH or Telnet security protocol is enabled, continue to the next step.
.. If the RSH or Telnet security protocol is not enabled, use the following command to enable it:
+
`security protocol modify -application <rsh/telnet> -enabled true` 

. Confirm that the `management-rsh-server` or `management-telnet-server` service exists on the management LIFs:
+
`network interface show -services management-rsh-server`
+
or
+ 
`network interface show -services management-telnet-server`

.. If the `management-rsh-server` or `management-telnet-server` service exists, continue to the next step.
.. If the `management-rsh-server` or `management-telnet-server` service does not exist, use the following command to add it:
+ 
`network interface service-policy add-service -vserver cluster1 -policy default-management -service management-rsh-server`
+
`network interface service-policy add-service -vserver cluster1 -policy default-management -service management-telnet-server`
