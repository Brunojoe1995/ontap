[.lead]
You can forward the audit log to a maximum of 10 destinations that you specify by using the `cluster log-forwarding create` command. For example, you can forward the log to a Splunk or syslog server for monitoring, analysis, or backup purposes.

.About this task

If the `cluster log-forwarding create` command cannot ping the destination host to verify connectivity, the command fails with an error. Although not recommended, using the `-force` parameter with the command bypasses the connectivity verification.

You can configure transmission security options when forwarding log files:

* Protocols for sending messages to the destination
+
You can select one of the following `-protocol` values:

 ** `udp-unencrypted`: User Datagram Protocol with no security (default)
 ** `tcp-unencrypted`: Transmission Control Protocol with no security
 ** `tcp-encrypted`: Transmission Control Protocol with Transport Layer Security (TLS)

* Verification of destination server identity
+
When you set the `-verify-server` parameter to `true`, the identity of the log forwarding destination is verified by validating its certificate. You can set the value to `true` only when you select the `tcp-encrypted` value in the `-protocol` field.

.Steps

. For each destination that you want to forward the audit log to, specify the destination IP address or host name and any security options.

cluster1::> cluster log-forwarding create -destination 192.168.123.96
-port 514 -facility user

cluster1::> cluster log-forwarding create -destination 192.168.123.98
-port 514 -protocol tcp-encrypted -facility user

. Verify that the destination records are correct by using the `cluster log-forwarding show` command.
