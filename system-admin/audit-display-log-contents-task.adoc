ONTAP records management activities in the /mroot/etc/log/mlog/audit.log file of a node.

The cluster's log file entries include the following:

* Time: the log entry timestamp
* Application: the application used to connect to the cluster. Possible values include the following: internal, console, ssh, http, ontapi, snmp, rsh, telnet, service-processor.
* User: the username of the remote user.
* State: the current state of the audit request, which can be success, pending, or error.
* Message: an optional field that might contain “error” or “additional information” about the status of a command.
* Session ID: the session ID on which the request is received. Each SSH session is assigned a session ID, and each http/ontapi/snmp request is assigned a unique session ID.
* Storage VM: the SVM through which the user connected.
* Scope: shows “svm” when the request is on a data storage VM; otherwise set to "cluster".
* Command ID: the ID for each command received on a CLI session (ZAPI/HTTP/SNMP requests do not have a command ID.). This enables you to correlate a request and response.

You can display the cluster's log entries from the ONTAP CLI, and beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, from System Manager.
