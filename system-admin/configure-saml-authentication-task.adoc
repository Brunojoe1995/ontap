Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, you can configure Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication for web services. When SAML authentication is configured and enabled, users are authenticated by an external Identity Provider (IdP) instead of the directory service providers such as Active Directory and LDAP.

.What you'll need

* You must have configured the IdP for SAML authentication.
* You must have the IdP URI.

.About this task

* SAML authentication applies only to the `http` and `ontapi` applications.
+
The `http` and `ontapi` applications are used by the following web services: Service Processor Infrastructure, ONTAP APIs, or System Manager.

* SAML authentication is applicable only for accessing the admin SVM.

The following IdPs have been validated with System Manager: 

* Active Directory Federation Services
* Cisco DUO (validated with the following ONTAP versions:)
** 9.7P21 and later 9.7 patches (refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/online-help-96-97/task_setting_up_saml_authentication.html[System Manager Classic documentation^])
** 9.8P17 and later 9.8 patches
** 9.9.1P13 and later 9.9 patches
** 9.10.1P9 and later 9.10 patches
** 9.11.1P4 and later 9.11 patches
** 9.12.1
* Shibboleth

.Steps

. Create a SAML configuration so that ONTAP can access the IdP metadata:
+
`*security saml-sp create -idp-uri _idp_uri_ -sp-host _ontap_host_name_*`
+
`idp_uri` is the FTP or HTTP address of the IdP host from where the IdP metadata can be downloaded.
+
`ontap_host_name` is the host name or IP address of the SAML service provider host, which in this case is the ONTAP system. By default, the IP address of the cluster-management LIF is used.
+
You can optionally provide the ONTAP server certificate information. By default, the ONTAP web server certificate information is used.

[Job 179] Job succeeded: Access the SAML SP metadata using the URL:
https://10.63.56.150/saml-sp/Metadata

Configure the IdP and Data ONTAP users for the same directory server domain to ensure that users are the same for different authentication methods. See the "security login show" command for the Data ONTAP user configuration.
----
+
The URL to access the ONTAP host metadata is displayed.

. From the IdP host, configure the IdP with the ONTAP host metadata.
+
For more information about configuring the IdP, see the IdP documentation.

. Enable SAML configuration:
+
`*security saml-sp modify -is-enabled true*`
+
Any existing user that accesses the `http` or `ontapi` application is automatically configured for SAML authentication.

. If you want to create users for the `http` or `ontapi` application after SAML is configured, specify SAML as the authentication method for the new users.
 .. Create a login method for new users with SAML authentication:
 +
 `*security login create -user-or-group-name _user_name_ -application [http | ontapi] -authentication-method saml -vserver _svm_name_*`
+
----
cluster_12::> security login create -user-or-group-name admin1 -application http -authentication-method saml -vserver  cluster_12

 .. Verify that the user entry is created:
+
`*security login show*`
+

== Disable SAML authentication

You can disable SAML authentication when you want to stop authenticating web users by using an external Identity Provider (IdP). When SAML authentication is disabled, the configured directory service providers such as Active Directory and LDAP are used for authentication.

.What you'll need

You must be logged in from the console.

.Steps

. Disable SAML authentication:
+
`*security saml-sp modify -is-enabled false*`
. If you no longer want to use SAML authentication or if you want to modify the IdP, delete the SAML configuration:
+
`*security saml-sp delete*`

== Troubleshoot issues with SAML configuration

If configuring Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication fails, you can manually repair each node on which the SAML configuration failed and recover from the failure. During the repair process, the web server is restarted and any active HTTP connections or HTTPS connections are disrupted.

.About this task

When you configure SAML authentication, ONTAP applies SAML configuration on a per-node basis. When you enable SAML authentication, ONTAP automatically tries to repair each node if there are configuration issues. If there are issues with SAML configuration on any node, you can disable SAML authentication and then reenable SAML authentication. There can be situations when SAML configuration fails to apply on one or more nodes even after you reenable SAML authentication. You can identify the node on which SAML configuration has failed and then manually repair that node.

.Steps

. Log in to the advanced privilege level:
+
`*set -privilege advanced*`
. Identify the node on which SAML configuration failed:
+
`*security saml-sp status show -instance*`
+
