AutoSupport case suppression enables you to stop unnecessary cases from being created by AutoSupport messages that are triggered during scheduled maintenance windows.

To suppress AutoSupport cases, you must manually invoke an AutoSupport message with a specially formatted text string: `MAINT=xh`. `x` is the duration of the maintenance window in units of hours.
