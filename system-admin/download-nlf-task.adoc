summary: "In ONTAP 9.10.1 and later, features are enabled with a NetApp license file (NLF), and in releases earlier than ONTAP 9.10.1, ONTAP features are enabled with license keys. You can install NetApp license files and license keys using System Manager, which is the preferred method for installing NLFs, or you can use the ONTAP CLI to install license keys."

If your system is running ONTAP 9.10.1 or later, you can convert the license files on existing systems by downloading the NLF for ONTAP One or ONTAP Core from the NetApp Support Site. 

If your system was sold with Core Bundle and Data Protection Bundle with NLFs, these two NLFs combined have the same feature set as a single ONTAP One NLF.
