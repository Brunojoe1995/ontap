If your system is running ONTAP 9.10.1 or later, you can convert the bundle license files on existing systems by downloading the NLF for ONTAP One or ONTAP Core from the NetApp Support Site. 

If your system was sold with Core Bundle and Data Protection Bundle with NLFs, these two NLFs combined have the same feature set as a single ONTAP One NLF. 

.Before you begin

You will need the locate and record the cluster UUID for the cluster you want to license if you want to enable SnapMirror Cloud. The cluster UUID is required when you request and download the ONTAP Cloud Compatibility bundle.

.Steps

You can download ONTAP One license files for systems with existing NetApp license file bundles and for systems with 28-character license keys that have been converted to NetApp license files on systems running ONTAP 9.10.1 and later. For a fee, you can also upgrade systems from ONTAP Base to ONTAP One.
