If you prefer to use a graphic interface instead of the command-line interface (CLI) for accessing and managing a cluster, you can do so by using System Manager, which is included with ONTAP as a web service, is enabled by default, and is accessible by using a browser.

.What you'll need

* You must have a cluster user account that is configured with the `admin` role and the `http` and `console` application types.
* You must have enabled cookies and site data in the browser.

.About this task

You can use a cluster management LIF or node management LIF to access System Manager. For uninterrupted access to System Manager, you should use a cluster management LIF.

.Steps

. Point the web browser to the IP address of the cluster management LIF:
 ** If you are using IPv4: `*https://__cluster-mgmt-LIF__*`
 ** If you are using IPv6: `*https://[_cluster-mgmt-LIF_]*`
[NOTE]
Only HTTPS is supported for browser access of System Manager.

+
If the cluster uses a self-signed digital certificate, the browser might display a warning indicating that the certificate is not trusted. You can either acknowledge the risk to continue the access or install a Certificate Authority (CA) signed digital certificate on the cluster for server authentication.

. *Optional:* If you have configured an access banner by using the CLI, then read the message that is displayed in the *Warning* dialog box, and choose the required option to proceed.
+
This option is not supported on systems on which Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled.

 ** If you do not want to continue, click *Cancel*, and close the browser.
 ** If you want to continue, click *OK* to navigate to the System Manager login page.

. Log in to System Manager by using your cluster administrator credentials.
