While SET requests are logged by default, GET requests are not. However, you can control whether GET requests sent from ONTAP HTML (-httpget), the ONTAP CLI (-cliget) or from the ONTAP APIs (-ontapiget) are logged in the file.

You can modify audit logging settings from the ONTAP CLI, and beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, from System Manager.
