ONTAP manual (man) pages explain how to use ONTAP commands. They are available at the command line and on the NetApp Support Site.

The `man _command_name_` command displays the manual page of the specified command. If you do not specify a command name, the manual page index is displayed. You can use the `man man` command to view information about the `man` command itself. You can exit a man page by entering `*q*`.
