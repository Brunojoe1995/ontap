Before you configure important EMS event notifications, you need to decide whether to send the notifications to an email address, a syslog server, an SNMP traphost, or REST API server.

.About this task

If your environment already contains a syslog server for aggregating the logged events from other systems, such as servers and applications, then it is easier to use that syslog server also for important event notifications from storage systems.

If your environment does not already contain a syslog server, then it is easier to use email for important event notifications.

If you already forward event notifications to an SNMP traphost, then you might want to monitor that traphost for important events.

.Choices

* Set EMS to send event notifications.
