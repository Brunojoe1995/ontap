= Configure important EMS events to forward notifications to a REST API server

[.lead]
To receive event notifications on a REST API server, you must configure REST API webhook support.

.Before you begin

* You need a server with REST API/webhook support capable of receiving EMS events.
* The REST API server can utilize server-side or client-side security certificates.
* Configuration for certificates is determined by destination. Refer to the following for an overview of certificate configuration based on destination:
**	*http*: - No certificate involved
**	*https*: - The server certificate is verified by the ONTAP system. Optionally, a client certificate can be configured that will be sent by the ONTAP system for the server to verify.
*	Client-side certificates require both the private key and a certificate available for installation on the source ONTAP system(s).

NOTE: If you are configuring both a client and server certificate REST API forward, a server-side certificate is required to utilize a client-side certificate. As a result, you must follow the client-side instructions to use both methods of authentication.

== Configuring an HTTP Rest API forward

.About this task
You can perform this task any time the cluster is running by entering the commands on the ONTAP command line.

.Steps
.	Create a new destination `restapi-ems` destination for the filter `important-events`:
+
`event notification destination create -name restapi-ems -rest-api-url \http://<url_to_rest_api_server>`

.	Create the notification that links the `important-events` filter with the new `restapi-ems` destination:
+
`event notification create -filter-name important-events -destinations restapi-ems`

== Configuring a server certificate HTTPS Rest API forward

.About this task

This procedure assumes you have previously generated a server-side private key and public certificate. It also assumes you have the root certificate available to install in ONTAP.

.Steps

.	Install the appropriate server private key and public certificates in your REST API server.
+
NOTE: Specific instructions depend on the server.

.	Install the server root certificate in ONTAP.
+
`security certificate install -type server-ca`
+
The command will query for the public certificate.
+
.	Create the `restapi-ems` destination for the filter `important-events`.
+
You must use the HTTPS scheme for the server-side certificate to be utilized.
+
`event notification destination create -name restapi-ems -rest-api-url \https://<url_to_rest_api_server>`
+
.	Create the notification that links the `important-events` filter with the new `restapi-ems` destination:
+
`event notification create -filter-name important-events -destinations restapi-ems`

== Configuring a client certificate HTTPS Rest API forward

.About this task
The usage of a client certificate is optional and only necessary if client authentication by the server is desired. This procedure assumes you have previously generated a client private key and public certificate.

.Steps

.	Install the appropriate root and intermediate certificates, in the Rest API server, to validate your client certificate.
.	Install the client certificate in ONTAP.
+
`security certificate install -type client`
+
The command will query for the private key and the public certificate.
+
.	Create the `restapi-ems` destination for the filter `important-events`.
+
`event notification destination create -name restapi-ems -rest-api-url \https://<url_to_rest_api_server> -certificate-authority <issuer of the client certificate> -certificate-serial <serial of the client certificate>`
+
.	Create the notification that links the `important-events` filter with the new `restapi-ems` destination.
+
`event notification create -filter-name important-events -destinations restapi-ems`
