Prior to ONTAP 9.0, EMS events could only be mapped to event destinations through a routing-based model. The ONTAP commands associated with that routing-based model continue to be available, but they have been deprecated starting with ONTAP 9.0 .

EMS event destination mapping transitioned to a more scalable notifications-based model starting with ONTAP 9.0. This content describes the process for migrating from the â€¦.

There are 2 types of event destinations:

.	*System generated destinations*: There are five system-generated event destinations (created by default)
+
* `allevents`
*	`asup`
*	`criticals`
*	`pager`
*	`traphost`
+
Some of the system generated destinations are for special purpose. For example, asup destination routes callhome.* events to the AutoSupport module in ONTAP to generate AutoSupports.
+
.	*User-created destinations*: These are manually created using the `event destination create` cmd.

In the deprecated routing-based model, EMS events are individually mapped to a destination using `event route add-destinations` command.

This command is deprecated. Use the "event filter", "event notification destination" and "event notification" commands, instead.

The new, more scalable EMS event notifications mechanism is based on event filters and event notification destinations. Refer to the following KB article for detailed information on the new event notification mechanism:
