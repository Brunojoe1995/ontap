To serve data from a mirror destination when a source becomes unavailable, stop scheduled transfers to the destination, and then break the SnapMirror relationship to make the destination writable.

.Steps

. Select the desired protection relationship: click *Protection > Relationships*, and then click the desired volume name.

. Click image:icon_kabob.gif[alt=More options].

. Stop scheduled transfers : click *Pause*.

. Make the destination writable: click *Break*.

. Go to the main *Relationships* page to verify that the relationship state displays as "broken off".

.Next steps:

When the disabled source volume is available again, you should resynchronize the relationship to copy the current data to the original source volume. This process replaces the data on the original source volume.
