This procedure creates new LUNs on an existing storage VM. LUNs appear as disks to the Windows host. Your FC or iSCSI protocol should already be set up.

. For FC, zone your FC switches by WWPN. Use one zone per initiator and include all target ports in each zone.

. On your Windows server, discover the new LUN.

. Initialize the LUN and optionally format it with a file system.

. Verify the Windows server can write and read data on the LUN.
