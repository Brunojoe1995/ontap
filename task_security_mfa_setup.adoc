Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication allows users to log in to an application by using a secure identity provider (IdP).

In System Manager, in addition to standard ONTAP authentication, SAML-based authentication is provided as an option for multifactor authentication.

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based framework for authentication and authorization between two entities: a service provider and an identity provider.

== Enable SAML authentication

To enable SAML authentication, perform the following steps:

.Steps

. Click *Cluster > Settings*.

. Next to *SAML Authentication*, click image:icon_gear.gif[gear icon].

. Ensure there is a check in the *Enable SAML Authentication* checkbox.

. Enter the URL of the IdP URI (including "https://").

. Modify the host system address, if needed.

. Ensure the correct certificate is being used:

* If your system was mapped with only one certificate with type "server", then that certificate is considered the default and it isn't displayed.

* If your system was mapped with multiple certificates as type "server", then one of the certificates is displayed.  To select a different certificate, click *Change*.

. Click *Save*. A confirmation window displays the metadata information, which has been automatically copied to your clipboard.

. Go to the IdP system you specified and copy the metadata from your clipboard to update the system metadata.

. Return to the confirmation window (in System Manager) and check the checkbox *I have configured the IdP with the host URI or metadata*.

. Click *Logout* to enable SAML-based authentication.  The IdP system will display an authentication screen.

. In the IdP system, enter your SAML-based credentials. After your credentials are verified, you will be directed to the System Manager home page.

== Disable SAML authentication

To disable SAML authentication, perform the following steps:

.Steps

. Click *Cluster > Settings*.

. Under *SAML Authentication*, click the *Enabled* toggle button.

. _Optional_:  You can also click  image:icon_gear.gif[gear icon] next to *SAML Authentication*, and then uncheck the *Enable SAML Authentication* checkbox.

//Removed section called  "Remove SAML authentication"
