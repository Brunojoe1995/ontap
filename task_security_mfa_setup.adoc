Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication allows users to log in to an application by using a secure identity provider (IdP).

In System Manager, in addition to standard ONTAP authentication, SAML-based authentication is provided as an option for multifactor authentication.

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based framework for authentication and authorization between two entities: a service provider and an identity provider.

== Enable SAML authentication

.Before you begin

* The IdP that you plan to use for remote authentication must be configured.
+
[NOTE]
====
See the documentation that is provided by the IdP that you have configured.
====

* You must have the URI of the IdP.

.About this task

The following IdPs have been validated with System Manager: 

* Active Directory Federation Services
* Cisco DUO (validated with the following ONTAP versions:)
** 9.7P21 and later 9.7 releases 
** 9.8P17 and later 9.8 releases
** 9.9.1P13 and later 9.9 releases
** 9.10.1P9 and later 9.10 releases
** 9.11.1P4 and later 9.11 releases
** 9.12.1 and later releases
* Shibboleth

NOTE: After SAML authentication is enabled, only remote users can access the System Manager GUI. Local users cannot access the System Manager GUI after SAML authentication is enabled.

To enable SAML authentication, perform the following steps:

.Steps

. Click *Cluster > Settings*.

. Next to *SAML Authentication*, click image:icon_gear.gif[gear icon].

. Ensure there is a check in the *Enable SAML Authentication* checkbox.

. Enter the URL of the IdP URI (including "https://").

. Modify the host system address, if needed.

. Ensure the correct certificate is being used:

* If your system was mapped with only one certificate with type "server", then that certificate is considered the default and it isn't displayed.

* If your system was mapped with multiple certificates as type "server", then one of the certificates is displayed.  To select a different certificate, click *Change*.

. Click *Save*. A confirmation window displays the metadata information, which has been automatically copied to your clipboard.

. Go to the IdP system you specified and copy the metadata from your clipboard to update the system metadata.

. Return to the confirmation window (in System Manager) and check the checkbox *I have configured the IdP with the host URI or metadata*.

. Click *Logout* to enable SAML-based authentication.  The IdP system will display an authentication screen.

. In the IdP system, enter your SAML-based credentials. After your credentials are verified, you will be directed to the System Manager home page.

== Disable SAML authentication

To disable SAML authentication, perform the following steps:

.About this task
Disabling SAML authentication does not delete the SAML configuration.

.Steps

. Click *Cluster > Settings*.

. Under *SAML Authentication*, click the *Enabled* toggle button.

. _Optional_:  You can also click  image:icon_gear.gif[gear icon] next to *SAML Authentication*, and then uncheck the *Enable SAML Authentication* checkbox.

//Removed section called  "Remove SAML authentication"

//After SAML authentication has been configured for your system, to remove SAML authentication, perform the following steps:

//.Steps

//. Click *Cluster > Settings*.

//. Next to *SAML Authentication*, click image:icon_gear.gif[gear icon].

//. Complete the fields, but enter an IdP URL that is _not_ valid.

//. Click *Save*. The system will remove the existing SAML configuration.
