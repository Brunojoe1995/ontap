The following table lists common virus scanning issues, their possible causes and ways to resolve them. Virus scanning is also known as Vscan.

[options="header"]
|===
| Issue | How to resolve it
a|
The Vscan servers are not able to connect to 
the clustered Data ONTAP storage system.
a|
Check whether the scanner pool configuration specifies the 
Vscan server IP address. Check also if the allowed 
privileged users in the scanner pool list are active. To check the scanner pool, run the `vserver vscan scanner-pool show` command on the storage system command prompt.
If the Vscan servers still cannot connect, there might be an issue with the network.
a|
Clients observe high latency
a|
It is probably time to add more Vscan servers to the 
scanner pool.
a|
Too many scans are triggered
a|
Modify the value of the vscan-fileop-profile
parameter to restrict the number of file operations 
monitored for virus scanning.

a|
Some files are not being scanned.
a|
Check the on-access policy. It is possible that the path for 
these files has been added to the path-exclusion list or that 
their size exceeds the configured value for exclusions. To 
check the on-access policy, run the vserver vscan 
on-access-policy show command on the storage 
system command prompt.
a|
File access is denied.
a|
Check whether the scan-mandatory setting is specified 
in the policy configuration. This setting denies data access 
if no Vscan servers are connected. Modify the setting as 
appropriate
