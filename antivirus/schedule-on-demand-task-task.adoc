You can create a task without assigning a schedule and use the `vserver vscan on-demand-task schedule` command to assign a schedule; or add a schedule while creating the task.

.About this task

The schedule assigned with the `vserver vscan on-demand-task schedule` command overrides a schedule already assigned with the `vserver vscan on-demand-task create` command.

.Steps

. Schedule an on-demand task:
+
`vserver vscan on-demand-task schedule -vserver data_SVM -task-name task_name -schedule cron_schedule`
+
The following command schedules an on-access task named `Task2` on the `vs2` SVM:
+
----
cluster1::> vserver vscan on-demand-task schedule -vserver vs2 -task-name Task2 -schedule daily
[Job 142]: Vscan On-Demand job is queued. Use the "job show -id 142" command to view the status.
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use the `job show` command to view the status of the job. You can use the `job pause` and `job resume` commands to pause and restart the job, or the `job stop` command to end the job.
====

. Verify that the on-demand task has been scheduled: 
+
`vserver vscan on-demand-task show -instance data_SVM -task-name task_name`
+
For a complete list of options, see the man page for the command.
+
The following command displays the details for the `Task 2` task:
+
----
cluster1::> vserver vscan on-demand-task show -instance vs2 -task-name Task2

                           Vserver: vs2
                         Task Name: Task2

.After you finish

You must enable scanning on the SVM before the task is scheduled to run.
