You can use NetApp virus scanning, called _Vscan_, to protect data from being compromised by viruses or other malicious code. It shows you how to use on-access scanning to check for viruses when clients access files over CIFS, and how to use on-demand scanning to check for viruses immediately or on a schedule.

You can work with Vscan by using the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI), not System Manager or an automated scripting tool. Vscan is not supported by System Manager.
