[.lead]
You can use on-demand scanning to check files for viruses immediately or on a schedule. 

You might want to run scans only in off-peak hours, for example, or you might want to scan very large files that were excluded from an on-access scan. You can use a cron schedule to specify when the task runs.

.About this topic

* You can assign a schedule when you create a task.
* Only one task can be scheduled at a time on an SVM.
* On-demand scanning does not support scanning of symbolic links or stream files.
