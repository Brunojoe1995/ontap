summary: "An on-access policy defines the scope of an on-access scan. You can specify the maximum size of the files to be scanned, the extensions of the files to be included in the scan, and the extensions and paths of the files to be excluded from the scan.

An on-access policy defines the scope of an on-access scan. You can specify the maximum size of the files to be scanned, the extensions of the files to be included in the scan, and the extensions and paths of the files to be excluded from the scan. You can create an on-access policy for an individual SVM or for all the SVMs in a cluster.

.About this task

By default, ONTAP creates an on-access policy named "`default_CIFS`" and enables it for all the SVMs in a cluster.

You can set the `scan-mandatory` option to off to specify that file access is allowed when no Vscan servers are available for virus scanning. Keep in mind that any file that qualifies for scan exclusion based on the `paths-to-exclude`, `file-ext-to-exclude`, or `max-file-size` parameters is not considered for scanning even if the `scan-mandatory` option is set to on.

[NOTE]
====
For potential issues related to the `scan-mandatory` option, see xref:vscan-server-connection-concept.adoc[Potential connectivity issues involving the scan-mandatory option].
====

By default, only read-write volumes are scanned. You can specify filters that enable scanning of read-only volumes or that restrict scanning to files opened with execute access.

.Steps

. Create an on-access policy:
+
`vserver vscan on-access-policy create -vserver _data_SVM|cluster_admin_SVM_ -policy-name _policy_name_ -protocol CIFS -max-file-size _max_size_of_files_to_scan_ –filters [scan-ro-volume,][scan-execute-access] -file-ext-to-include _extensions_of_files_to_include_ -file-ext-to-exclude _extensions_of_files_to_exclude_ -scan-files-with-no-ext true|false -paths-to-exclude _paths_of_files_to_exclude_ -scan-mandatory on|off`
+
 ** Specify a data SVM for a policy defined for an individual SVM, a cluster admin SVM for a policy defined for all the SVMs in a cluster.
 ** The `-file-ext-to-exclude` setting overrides the `-file-ext-to-include` setting.
 ** Set `-scan-files-with-no-ext` to true to scan files without extensions.
The following command creates an on-access policy named `Policy1` on the ``vs1``SVM:

+
----
cluster1::> vserver vscan on-access-policy create -vserver vs1 -policy-name Policy1 -protocol CIFS -filters scan-ro-volume -max-file-size 3GB -file-ext-to-include “mp*”,"tx*" -file-ext-to-exclude "mp3","txt" -scan-files-with-no-ext false -paths-to-exclude "\vol\a b\","\vol\a,b\"
----
. Verify that the on-access policy has been created: `vserver vscan on-access-policy show -instance _data_SVM|cluster_admin_SVM_ -policy-name policy_name`
+
For a complete list of options, see the man page for the command.
+
The following command displays the details for the `Policy1` policy:
+

cluster1::> vserver vscan on-access-policy show -instance vs1 -policy-name Policy1
