Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, you can perform an in-place conversion of a FlexVol volume to a FlexGroup volume without requiring a data copy or additional disk space.

.What you'll need

* Transitioned volumes can be converted to FlexGroup volumes beginning in ONTAP 9.8. If you are converting a transitioned volume to FlexGroup, see Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/ONTAP_OS/How_To_Convert_a_Transitioned_FlexVol_to_FlexGroup[How To Convert a Transitioned FlexVol to FlexGroup] for more information.
* The FlexVol volume that is being converted must be online.
* The operations and configurations on the FlexVol volume must be compatible with the conversion process.
+
An error message is generated if the FlexVol volume has any incompatibility and the volume conversion is aborted. You can take corrective actions and retry the conversion.
* If a FlexVol volume is very large (for example, 80 to 100 TB) and very full (80 to 100 percent), you should copy the data rather than convert it. 
+
[NOTE]
====
Converting a very large FlexGroup volume results in a very full FlexGroup volume member constituent, which can create performance issues. For more information, see the section called "When not to create a FlexGroup volume" in the TR link:https://www.netapp.com/media/12385-tr4571.pdf[FlexGroup volumes - Best Practices and Implementation Guide].
====

.Steps

. Verify that the FlexVol volume is online: `volume show vol_name -volume-style-extended,state`
+
----
cluster-1::> volume show my_volume -fields volume-style-extended,state
vserver volume    state  volume-style-extended
------- --------- ------ ---------------------
vs0     my_volume online flexvol
----

. Verify whether the FlexVol volume can be converted without issues:
 .. Log in to the advance privilege mode: `set -privilege advanced`
 .. Verify the conversion process: `volume conversion start -vserver vs1 -volume flexvol -check-only true`
+
You must rectify all errors before converting the volume.
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot convert a FlexGroup volume back to a FlexVol volume.
====
. Start the conversion: `volume conversion start -vserver svm_name -volume vol_name`
+
----
cluster-1::*> volume conversion start -vserver vs0 -volume my_volume

Warning: Converting flexible volume "my_volume" in Vserver "vs0" to a FlexGroup
         will cause the state of all Snapshot copies from the volume to be set
         to "pre-conversion". Pre-conversion Snapshot copies cannot be
         restored.

. Verify that the conversion is successful: `volume show vol_name -fields -volume-style-extended,state`
+
----
cluster-1::*> volume show my_volume -fields volume-style-extended,state
vserver volume    state  volume-style-extended
------- --------- ------ ---------------------
vs0     my_volume online flexgroup
----

.Results

The FlexVol volume is converted to a single-member FlexGroup volume.

.After you finish

You can expand the FlexGroup volume, as required.
