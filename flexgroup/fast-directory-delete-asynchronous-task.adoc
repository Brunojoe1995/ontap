You should use the REST API to delete your directory. Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can also use the `volume file async-delete` command to delete files and directories from Linux and Windows client shares in the background. You can perform asynchronous delete on both FlexVol and FlexGroup volumes.

.About this task

If you are using a version of ONTAP earlier than ONTAP 9.11.1, you must be a cluster administrator or a SVM administrator using the advanced privilege mode.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, a cluster administrator can grant rights on a volume to allow NFS and SMB clients to perform asynchronous delete operations.  When async delete is enabled, NFS clients can use the move command, and SMB clients can use the rename command to delete a directory and move it to a hidden .ontaptrashbin directory.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can also use System Manager to perform a fast directory delete. For more information, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_nas_file_system_analytics_take_corrective_action.html[Take corrective action based on analytics].

.Steps

. Enter advanced privilege mode: `-privilege advance`
. Delete files or directories on a FlexVol or FlexGroup volume: `volume file async-delete start -vserver vserver_name -volume volume_name -path file_path -throttle throttle`
+
The minimum throttle value is 10, the maximum is 100,000, and the default is 5000.
+
The following example deletes the directory named d2, which is located in the directory named d1.
+
----
cluster::*>volume file async-delete start -vserver vs1 -volume vol1 -path d1/d2
----

. Verify that the directory was deleted: `event log show`
+
The following example shows output for the event log when the directory is successfully deleted.
+
----
cluster-cli::*> event log show
