[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use low-latency _fast-directory delete_ functionality to delete files and directories from Linux and Windows client shares asynchronously (that is, in the background). Cluster and SVM administrators can perform asynchronous delete operations on both FlexVol and FlexGroup volumes.

If you are using a version of ONTAP earlier than ONTAP 9.11.1, you must be a cluster administrator or a SVM administrator using the advanced privilege mode.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, a storage administrator can grant rights on a volume to allow NFS and SMB clients to perform asynchronous delete operations. For more information, see xref:manage-client-async-dir-delete-task.adoc[Manage client rights to delete directories rapidly].

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use fast directory delete functionality using the ONTAP CLI. Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can use this functionality with System Manager. For more information about this process, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_nas_file_system_analytics_take_corrective_action.html[Take corrective action based on analytics].

. Enter advanced privilege mode: `-privilege advance`
. Delete files or directories on a FlexVol or FlexGroup volume: `volume file async-delete start -vserver vserver_name -volume volume_name -path file_path -throttle throttle`
+
The minimum throttle value is 10, the maximum is 100,000, and the default is 5000.
+
The following example deletes the directory named d2, which is located in the directory named d1.
+
----
cluster::*>volume file async-delete start -vserver vs1 -volume vol1 -path d1/d2
----

. Verify that the directory was deleted: `event log show`
+
The following example shows output for the event log when the directory is successfully deleted.
+
----
cluster-cli::*> event log show
