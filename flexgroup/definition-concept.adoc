A FlexGroup volume is a scale-out NAS container that provides high performance along with automatic load distribution and scalability. A FlexGroup volume contains several constituents that automatically and transparently share the traffic. _Constituents_ are the underlying FlexVol volumes that make up a FlexGroup volume.

FlexGroup volumes provide the following benefits:

* High scalability
+
The maximum size for a FlexGroup volume in ONTAP 9.1 and later is 20 PB, with 400 billion files on a 10-node cluster.

* High performance
+
FlexGroup volumes can utilize the resources of the cluster to serve workloads that have high throughput and low latency.

* Simplified management
+
A FlexGroup volume is a single namespace container that can be managed in a similar way as FlexVol volumes.
