Using System Manager, you can add nodes to a cluster and rename them.  You can also reboot, take over, and give back nodes.  You can also generate a performance archive file for the nodes in the cluster and download it.

You can perform the following tasks:

== Add nodes to a cluster

You can increase the size and capabilities of your cluster by adding new nodes.

.Before you Start

You should have already cabled the new nodes to the cluster.

.About this task

There are separate processes for working with System Manager in ONTAP 9.7 or ONTAP 9.8.

* <<add-nodes-cluster-97,Adding nodes to a cluster with System Manager (ONTAP 9.7)>>

* <<add-nodes-cluster-98,Adding nodes to a cluster with System Manager (ONTAP 9.8)>>

[[add-nodes-cluster-97]]
=== Adding nodes to a cluster with System Manager (ONTAP 9.7)

.Steps

.	Click *(Return to classic version)*.

.	Click *Configurations > Cluster Expansion*.
+
System Manager automatically discovers the new nodes.

.	Click *Switch to the new experience*.

.	Click *Cluster > Overview* to view the new nodes.

[[add-nodes-cluster-98]]
=== Adding nodes to a cluster with System Manager (ONTAP 9.8)

.Steps

. Select *Cluster > Overview*.
+
The new controllers are shown as nodes connected to the cluster network but are not in the cluster.

. Click *Add*.
+
** The nodes are added into the cluster.

** Storage is allocated implicitly.

== Reboot, take over, and give back nodes

You should switch a node’s workload to its HA partner (takeover) before rebooting.

NOTE: You cannot shut down (halt) a node using System Manager; you must use CLI commands. Also, if the node is halted, you need to use CLI commands to bring it back online.  See link:system-admin/start-stop-storage-system-concept.html[Start or stop a node overview].

.Steps

. Click *Cluster > Overview*.
. Under *Nodes*, click image:icon_kabob.gif[menu icon].
. Click the node and select the desired action.

== Rename nodes

Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can rename a node from the cluster overview page.

.Steps

.	Click *Cluster*.  The cluster overview page displays.

.	Scroll down to the *Nodes* section.

.	Next to the node that you want to rename, click image:icon_kabob.gif[menu icon].

.	Select *Rename*.

.	Modify the node name, and then click *Rename*.

== Generate performance archive for nodes 

Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can generate a performance archive for nodes and download it.

.Steps

. Click *Cluster* > *Support*.  

. Select the *Generate performance archive* tab.
+
* The *Generate performance archive* page displays.
* A default is displayed for the *Start date and time* field, which is the current time minus 3 hours. (The time zone is derived from your browser settings.)
* A default is displayed for the *Time span* fields, which is 3 hours.

. To modify the start date and time, click the calendar icon and select the date and time.

. To modify the time span, type a number in the first field, and click the down-arrow in the second field to select the time units.

. (Optional) In the *File name prefix (optional)* field, specify a file name prefix.

. (Optional) In the *Case number (optional)* field, specify a case number.

. (Optional) In the *Message* field, you can summarize the issue.

. In the *Nodes* section, select the nodes for which you want to generate the performance archive. 

. Click *Generate*.
+  
* The generation of the report begins.  If you don’t want to wait for the report to be generated, you can then click *Run in background*. 

* While the report is being generated, you can view the settings that were specified to generate the report by clicking View details in the status message on the *Support* page.  If needed, you can stop the generation of the report from the details page that displays.

* When the report is finished being generated, a status message displays on the *Support* page indicating that the report is ready.  You can click *Download* to download the report to your computer or click *View Details* to see the settings that were used to generate the report.
