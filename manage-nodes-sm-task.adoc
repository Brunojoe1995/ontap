Using System Manager, you can add nodes to a cluster and rename them.  You can also reboot, take over, and give back nodes.  

You can perform the following tasks:

== Add nodes to a cluster

You can increase the size and capabilities of your cluster by adding new nodes.

.Before you Start

You should have already cabled the new nodes to the cluster.

.About this task

There are separate processes for working with System Manager in ONTAP 9.7 or ONTAP 9.8.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.ONTAP 9.7 procedure
--

[[add-nodes-cluster-97]]
*Adding nodes to a cluster with System Manager (ONTAP 9.7)*

.Steps

.	Select *(Return to classic version)*.

.	Select *Configurations > Cluster Expansion*.
+
System Manager automatically discovers the new nodes.

.	Select *Switch to the new experience*.

.	Select *Cluster > Overview* to view the new nodes.
--

.ONTAP 9.8 procedure
--

[[add-nodes-cluster-98]]
*Adding nodes to a cluster with System Manager (ONTAP 9.8)*

.Steps

. Select *Cluster > Overview*.
+
The new controllers are shown as nodes connected to the cluster network but are not in the cluster.

. Select *Add*.
+
** The nodes are added into the cluster.

** Storage is allocated implicitly.

== Reboot, take over, and give back nodes

You should switch a nodeâ€™s workload to its HA partner (takeover) before rebooting.

NOTE: You cannot shut down (halt) a node using System Manager; you must use CLI commands. Also, if the node is halted, you need to use CLI commands to bring it back online.  See link:system-admin/start-stop-storage-system-concept.html[Start or stop a node overview].

.Steps

. Select *Cluster > Overview*.
. Under *Nodes*, select image:icon_kabob.gif[menu icon].
. Select the node and select the desired action.

== Rename nodes

Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can rename a node from the cluster overview page.

.Steps

. Select *Cluster*.  The cluster overview page displays.

. Scroll down to the *Nodes* section.

. Next to the node that you want to rename, select image:icon_kabob.gif[menu icon], and select *Rename*.

. Modify the node name, and then select *Rename*.
