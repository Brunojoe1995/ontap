You can quickly configure an ONTAP 9 cluster to use the Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) to back up data directly to tape using a third-party backup application.

Configure NDMP in the following circumstances:

* The cluster is running ONTAP 9.
* You have a third-party backup application (also called a Data Management Application or DMA).
* You are a cluster administrator.
* You want to perform backup operations either at the cluster level (using the admin storage virtual machine (SVM)) or node level.
* Tape devices and an optional media server are installed.
* Tape devices are connected to the cluster through a Fibre Channel (FC) switch and not directly attached.
* At least one tape device has a logical unit number (LUN) of 0.
