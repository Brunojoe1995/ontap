After creating a consistency group,  you must initialize it.

[NOTE]
This workflow applies to users in ONTAP 9.8 and 9.9. If using these ONTAP CLI commands beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, they will still work to initialize a consistency group, however, is recommended that you manage consistency groups with System Manager or the ONTAP REST API. 

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster or storage VM administrator.

.About this task

You initialize the consistency group from the destination cluster.

.Steps

. Sign in to the ONTAP CLI at the destination cluster and initialize the consistency group:
+
`destination::>snapmirror initialize -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`

. Confirm that the initialization operation completed successfully. The status should be `InSync`.
+
`snapmirror show`
