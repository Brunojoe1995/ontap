SM-BC supports xref:../data-protection/supported-deployment-config-concept.html[fan-out configurations]. Using the `MirrorAllSnapshots` policy, your source volume can be mirrored to an SM-BC destination endpoint and to one or more asynchronous SnapMirror relationships. 

If you experience a failover on the SM-BC destination, the asynchronous SnapMirror destination will become unhealthy, and you must manually restore protection by deleting and recreating the relationship with the asynchronous SnapMirror endpoint.  

.Resume protection in a fan-out configuration
. Verify the failover has completed successfully:
`snapmirror failover show`
. On the asynchronous Snapmirror endpoint, delete the fan-out endpoint: 
`snapmirror delete -destination-path _destination_path_`
. On the third site, create an asynchronous SnapMirror relationships between the new SM-BC primary volume and the async fan-out destination volume: 
`snapmirror create -source-path _source_path_ -destination-path _destination_path_ -policy MirrorAllSnapshots -schedule _schedule_`
. Resynchronize the relationship: 
`SnapMirror resync -destination-path _destination_path_`
. Verify the relationship status and heath: 
`snapmirror show`
