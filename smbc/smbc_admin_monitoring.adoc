There are several SM-BC components and operations you can monitor.

== ONTAP mediator

During normal operations, the Mediator state should be connected. If it is in any other state, this might indicate an error condition. You can review the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-ems-9131/sm-mediator-events.html[Event Management System (EMS) messages^] to determine the error and appropriate corrective actions.


== Planned failover operations

You can monitor status and progress of a planned failover operation using the `snapmirror failover show` command. For example:

....
ClusterB::> snapmirror failover start -destination-path vs1:/cg/dcg1
....

Once the failover operation is complete, you can monitor the Synchronous SnapMirror protection status from the new destination cluster. For example:

....
ClusterA::> snapmirror show
....

Refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-ems-9131/smbc-pfo-events.html[EMS reference^] to learn about event messages and corrective actions. 

== Automatic unplanned failover operations

During an unplanned automatic failover, you can monitor the status of the operation using the `snapmirror failover show` command.

....
ClusterB::> snapmirror failover show -instance
Start Time: 9/23/2020 22:03:29
         Source Path: vs1:/cg/scg3
    Destination Path: vs3:/cg/dcg3
     Failover Status: completed
        Error Reason:
            End Time: 9/23/2020 22:03:30
Primary Data Cluster: cluster-2
Last Progress Update: -
       Failover Type: unplanned
  Error Reason codes: -
....

Refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-ems-9131/smbc-aufo-events.html[EMS reference^] to learn about event messages and about corrective actions. 

== SM-BC availability

You can check the availability of the SM-BC relationship using a series of commands, either on the primary cluster, the secondary cluster, or both.

Commands you use include the `snapmirror mediator show` command on both the primary and secondary cluster to check the connection and quorum status, the `snapmirror show` command, and the `volume show` command. For example:

....
SMBC_A::*> snapmirror mediator show
Mediator Address Peer Cluster     Connection Status Quorum Status
---------------- ---------------- ----------------- -------------
10.236.172.86    SMBC_B           connected         true
