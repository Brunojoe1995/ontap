There are several SM-BC components and operations you can monitor.

== ONTAP mediator

During normal operation, the Mediator state should be connected. If it is in any other state, this might indicate an error condition. You can review the Event Management System (EMS) messages to determine the error and appropriate corrective actions.

|===
|EMS Name |Description

|sm.mediator.added
|Mediator is added successfully
|sm.mediator.removed
|Mediator is removed successfully
|sm.mediator.unusable
|Mediator is unusable due to a corrupted Mediator server
|sm.mediator.misconfigured
|Mediator is repurposed or the Mediator package is no longer installed on the Mediator server
|sm.mediator.unreachable
|Mediator is unreachable
|sm.mediator.removed.force
|Mediator is removed from the cluster using the "force" option
|sm.mediator.cacert.expiring
|Mediator certificate authority (CA) certificate is due to expire in 30 days or less
|sm.mediator.serverc.expiring
|Mediator server certificate is due to expire in 30 days or less
|sm.mediator.clientc.expiring
|Mediator client certificate is due to expire in 30 days or less
|sm.mediator.cacert.expired
|Mediator certificate authority (CA) certificate has expired
|sm.mediator.serverc.expired
|Mediator server certificate has expired
|sm.mediator.clientc.expired
|Mediator client certificate has expired
|sm.mediator.in.quorum
|All the SM-BC records are resynchronized with Mediator

== Planned failover operations

You can monitor status and progress of a planned failover operation using the `snapmirror failover show` command. For example:

....
ClusterB::> snapmirror failover start -destination-path vs1:/cg/dcg1
....

Once the failover operation is complete, you can monitor the Synchronous SnapMirror protection status from the new destination cluster. For example:

....
ClusterA::> snapmirror show
....

You can also review the following messages to determine if there is an error and take the appropriate corrective actions.

|===
|EMS Name |Description

|smbc.pfo.failed
|SMBC planned failover operation failed. Destination path:
|smbc.pfo.start. Destination path:
|SMBC planned failover operation started
|smbc.pfo.completed: SMBC planned failover operation completed. Destination path:
|===

== Automatic unplanned failover operations

During an unplanned automatic failover, you can monitor the status of the operation using the `snapmirror failover show` command. For example:

....
ClusterB::> snapmirror failover show -instance
Start Time: 9/23/2020 22:03:29
         Source Path: vs1:/cg/scg3
    Destination Path: vs3:/cg/dcg3
     Failover Status: completed
        Error Reason:
            End Time: 9/23/2020 22:03:30
Primary Data Cluster: cluster-2
Last Progress Update: -
       Failover Type: unplanned
  Error Reason codes: -
....

You can also review the following messages to determine if there is an error and take the appropriate corrective actions.

|===
|EMS Name |Description

|smbc.aufo.failed
|SnapMirror automatic planned failover operation failed. Destination path:
|smbc.aufo.start
|SMBC planned failover operation started. Destination path:
|smbc.aufo.completed:
|SnapMirror automatic planned failover operation completed. Destination path:
|smbc.aufo.failover.incapable
|block.giveback.during.aufo

== SM-BC availability

You can check the availability of the SM-BC relationship using a series of commands, either on the primary cluster, the secondary cluster, or both.

Commands you use include the `snapmirror mediator show` command on both the primary and secondary cluster to check the connection and quorum status, the `snapmirror show` command, and the `volume show` command. For example:

....
SMBC_A::*> snapmirror mediator show
Mediator Address Peer Cluster     Connection Status Quorum Status
---------------- ---------------- ----------------- -------------
10.236.172.86    SMBC_B           connected         true
