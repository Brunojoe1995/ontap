There are several considerations, restrictions, and limitations to consider using the SnapMirror Business Continuity solution.

== Object limits

=== Consistency groups in a cluster
Consistency group limits for a cluster with SM-BC are calculated based on relationships and depend on the version of ONTAP used. Limits are platform-independent. 

[options="header"]
|===
| ONTAP version | Maximum number of relationships
| ONTAP 9.8-9.9.1 | 5
| ONTAP 9.10.1 | 20
| ONTAP 9.11.1 | 50
|===

=== Volumes per consistency group

From ONTAP 9.8 to 9.9.1, the maximum number of volumes supported per SM-BC consistency group relationship is twelve, a limit which is platform-independent. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, the maximum number of volumes supported per SM-BC relationship is sixteen.

=== Volumes

Limits in SM-BC are calculated based on the number of endpoints, not the number of relationships. A consistency group with 12 volumes contributes 12 endpoints on both the source and destination. Both SM-BC and SnapMirror Synchronous relationships contribute to the total number of endpoints.

The maximum endpoints per platform are included in the following table.

[options="header"]
|===
| S. No |Platform 3+| Endpoints per HA for SM-BC 3+| Overall sync and SM-BC endpoints per HA
|

|ONTAP 9.8-9.9.1 |ONTAP 9.10.1 |ONTAP 9.11.1 |ONTAP 9.8-9.9.1 |ONTAP 9.10.1 |ONTAP 9.11.1

=== SAN object limits

The following SAN object limits are included in the following table and apply regardless of the platform.

|Limits of objects in an SM-BC relationship |Count

|LUNs per volume
|256
|LUN maps per node
|2048
|LUN maps per cluster
|4096
|LIFs per VServer (with at least one volume in an SM-BC relationship)
|256
|Inter-cluster LIFs per node

|Inter-cluster LIFs per cluster

== Supported configurations and features

SM-BC is supported with numerous operating systems and ONTAP features, including: 

* AIX (beginning ONTAP 9.11.1)
* Fan-out configurations
* HP-UX (beginning ONTAP 9.10.1)
* NDMP copy (beginning ONTAP 9.13.1)
* Partial file restore (beginning ONTAP 9.12.1)
* Solaris 11.4 (beginning ONTAP 9.10.1)

=== AIX

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, AIX is supported with SM-BC. With an AIX configuration, the primary cluster is the "active" cluster.

In an AIX configuration, failovers are disruptive. With each failover, you will need to perform a re-scan on the host for I/O operations to resume. 

To configure for AIX host with SM-BC, refer to the Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Protection_and_Security/SnapMirror/How_to_configure_an_AIX_host_for_SnapMirror_Business_Continuity_(SM-BC)[How to configure an AIX host for SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC)].

=== HP-UX known issues and limitations for SM-BC configuration

Beginning in ONTAP 9.10.1, SM-BC for HP-UX is supported. If an automatic unplanned failover (AUFO) event occurs on the isolated master cluster in the SM-BC configuration, it might take more than 120 seconds for I/O to resume on the HP-UX host. Depending on the applications that are running, this might not lead to any I/O disruption or error messages. If an AUFO event on the isolated master cluster occurs, you must restart applications on the HP-UX host that have a disruption tolerance of less than 120 seconds.

An AUFO event on the isolated master cluster might cause dual event failure when the connection between the primary and the secondary cluster is lost and the connection between the primary cluster and the mediator is also lost. This is considered a rare event, unlike other AUFO events.

=== FabricPool 

SM-BC supports source and destination volumes on FabricPool aggregates with the tiering policy of None, Snapshot or Auto. SM-S SM-BC does not support FabricPool aggregates using a tiering policy of All.

=== Fan-out configurations

SM-BC supports xref:../data-protection/supported-deployment-config-concept.html[fan-out configurations] with the `MirrorAllSnapshots` policy and, beginning in ONTAP 9.11.1, the `MirrorAndVault` policy. Fan-out configurations are not supported in SM-BC with the `XDPDefault` policy. 

If you experience a failover on the SM-BC destination in a fan-out configuration, you will have to manually xref:resume-protection-fan-out-configuration.html[resume protection in the fan-out configuration].

=== NDMP restore

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can use NDMP to copy and restore data with SM-BC. Using NDMP allows you to move data onto the SM-BC source to complete a restore without pausing protection. This is particularly useful in fan-out configurations. 

To learn more about this process, see xref:../tape-backup/transfer-data-ndmpcopy-task.html[Transfer data using ndmp copy].

=== Partial file restore

Beginning in ONTAP 9.12.1, partial LUN restore is supported for SM-BC volumes. For information on this process, refer to link:../data-protection/restore-part-file-snapshot-task.html[Restore part of a file from a Snapshot copy].

=== Solaris Host setting recommendation for SM-BC configuration

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, SM-BC supports Solaris 11.4. To ensure the Solaris client applications are non-disruptive when an unplanned site failover switchover occurs in an SM-BC environment, you must configure the Solaris 11.4 Host with the `f_tpgs` parameter.

Follow these steps to configure the override parameter:

. Create configuration file `/etc/driver/drv/scsi_vhci.conf` with an entry similar to the following for the NetApp storage type connected to the host:
+
----
scsi-vhci-failover-override =
"NETAPP  LUN","f_tpgs"
----
. Use `devprop` and `mdb` commands to verify the override has been successfully applied:
+
----
root@host-A:~# devprop -v -n /scsi_vhci scsi-vhci-failover-override scsi-vhci-failover-override=NETAPP  LUN + f_tpgs
root@host-A:~# echo "*scsi_vhci_dip::print -x struct dev_info devi_child | ::list struct dev_info devi_sibling| ::print struct dev_info devi_mdi_client| ::print mdi_client_t ct_vprivate| ::print struct scsi_vhci_lun svl_lun_wwn svl_fops_name"| mdb -k`
----
+
----
svl_lun_wwn = 0xa002a1c8960 "600a098038313477543f524539787938"
svl_fops_name = 0xa00298d69e0 "conf f_tpgs"
----

NOTE: `conf` will be added to the `svl_fops_name` when a `scsi-vhci-failover-override` has been applied.
