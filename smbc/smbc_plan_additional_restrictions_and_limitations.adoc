There are several additional restrictions and limitations when using the SnapMirror Business Continuity solution.

=== Consistency groups

From ONTAP 9.8 to 9.9.1, the maximum number of SM-BC consistency group relationships in a cluster is five, a limit which is platform-independent. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, the maximum number of SM-BC consistency group relationships in a cluster is 20.

=== Volumes per consistency group

From ONTAP 9.8 to 9.9.1, the maximum number of volumes supported per SM-BC consistency group relationship is twelve, a limit which is platform-independent. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, the maximum number of volumes supported per SM-BC relationship is sixteen.

=== Volumes

[NOTE]
The limit is on the number of endpoints and not the number of relationships. A consistency group with 12 volumes contributes 12 endpoints on both the source and destination. A SM-BC relationship with both source and destination volumes on the same HA pair contributes 2 endpoints. Both SM-BC and SnapMirror Synchronous relationships contribute to the endpoint limit. 

The maximum endpoints per platform are included in the following table.

=== SAN object limits

The following SAN object limits are included in the following table and apply regardless of the platform.

|LIFs per VServer (with at least one volume in an SM-BC relationship)

|Inter-cluster LIFs per node

|Inter-cluster LIFs per cluster

=== NTFS Security Style

NTFS security style is not supported on SM-BC volumes.

=== Solaris Host setting recommendation for SM-BC configuration

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, SM-BC supports Solaris 11.4. In order to ensure the Solaris client applications are non-disruptive when an unplanned site failover switchover occurs in an SM-BC environment, the following setting needs to be configured on Solaris 11.4 host. This setting will override the failover module â€“ `f_tpgs` in order to prevent the code path that detects the contradiction from being executed.

Follow the instructions to configure the override parameter:

. Create configuration file `/etc/driver/drv/scsi_vhci.conf` with an entry similar to the following for the NetApp storage type connected to the host:
+
----
scsi-vhci-failover-override =
"NETAPP  LUN","f_tpgs"
----
. Use `devprop` and `mdb` commands to verify the override has been successfully applied:
+
----
root@host-A:~# devprop -v -n /scsi_vhci scsi-vhci-failover-override scsi-vhci-failover-override=NETAPP  LUN + f_tpgs
root@host-A:~# echo "*scsi_vhci_dip::print -x struct dev_info devi_child | ::list struct dev_info devi_sibling| ::print struct dev_info devi_mdi_client| ::print mdi_client_t ct_vprivate| ::print struct scsi_vhci_lun svl_lun_wwn svl_fops_name"| mdb -k`
----
+
----
svl_lun_wwn = 0xa002a1c8960 "600a098038313477543f524539787938"
svl_fops_name = 0xa00298d69e0 "conf f_tpgs"
----

NOTE: `conf` will be added to the `svl_fops_name` when a `scsi-vhci-failover-override` has been applied.
