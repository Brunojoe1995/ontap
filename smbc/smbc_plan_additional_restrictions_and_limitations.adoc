There are several additional restrictions and limitations when using the SnapMirror Business Continuity solution.

=== Consistency groups

From ONTAP 9.8 to 9.9.1, the maximum number of SM-BC consistency group relationships in a cluster is five, a limit which is platform-independent. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, the maximum number of SM-BC consistency group relationships in a cluster is 20.

=== Volumes per consistency group

From ONTAP 9.8 to 9.9.1, the maximum number of volumes supported per SM-BC consistency group relationship is twelve, a limit which is platform-independent. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, the maximum number of volumes supported per SM-BC relationship is sixteen.

=== Volumes

Limits in SM-BC are calculated based on the number of endpoints, not the number of relationships. A consistency group with 12 volumes contributes 12 endpoints on both the source and destination. Both SM-BC and SnapMirror Synchronous relationships contribute to the total number of endpoints.

The maximum endpoints per platform are included in the following table.

=== NTFS Security Style

NTFS security style is not supported on SM-BC volumes.

=== Solaris Host setting recommendation for SM-BC configuration

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, SM-BC supports Solaris 11.4. To ensure the Solaris client applications are nondisruptive when an unplanned site failover switchover occurs in an SM-BC environment, the following setting must be configured on Solaris 11.4 Host. This setting overrides failover module â€“ `f_tpgs` to prevent the code path that detects the contradiction from being executed.

Follow these steps to configure the override parameter:

. Create configuration file `/etc/driver/drv/scsi_vhci.conf` with an entry similar to the following for the NetApp storage type connected to the host:
+
----
scsi-vhci-failover-override =
"NETAPP  LUN","f_tpgs"
----
. Use `devprop` and `mdb` commands to verify the override has been successfully applied:
+
----
root@host-A:~# devprop -v -n /scsi_vhci scsi-vhci-failover-override scsi-vhci-failover-override=NETAPP  LUN + f_tpgs
root@host-A:~# echo "*scsi_vhci_dip::print -x struct dev_info devi_child | ::list struct dev_info devi_sibling| ::print struct dev_info devi_mdi_client| ::print mdi_client_t ct_vprivate| ::print struct scsi_vhci_lun svl_lun_wwn svl_fops_name"| mdb -k`
----
+
----
svl_lun_wwn = 0xa002a1c8960 "600a098038313477543f524539787938"
svl_fops_name = 0xa00298d69e0 "conf f_tpgs"
----

NOTE: `conf` will be added to the `svl_fops_name` when a `scsi-vhci-failover-override` has been applied.

=== HP-UX Known issues and limitations for SM-BC configuration

Beginning in ONTAP 9.10.1, SM-BC for HP-UX is supported. If an automatic unplanned failover (AUFO) event occurs on the isolated master cluster in the SM-BC configuration, it might take more than 120 seconds for I/O to resume on the HP-UX host. Depending on the applications that are running, this might not lead to any I/O disruption or error messages. If an AUFO event on the isolated master cluster occurs, you must restart applications on the HP-UX host that have a disruption tolerance of less than 120 seconds.

An AUFO event on the isolated master cluster might cause dual event failure when the connection between the primary and the secondary cluster is lost and the connection between the primary cluster and the mediator is also lost. This is considered a rare event, unlike other AUFO events.
