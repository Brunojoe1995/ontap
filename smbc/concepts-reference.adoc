As you begin to explore the ONTAP SnapMirror Business Continuity and plan a deployment, it is helpful to become familiar with the key terminology and concepts.

.Consistency group

A consistency group is a collection of volumes that provide a write-order consistency guarantee for the application workload which needs to be protected for business continuity. A consistency group ensures all volumes of this data set are quiesced and then snapped at the same point in time. This provides a data consistent restore point across volumes for that data set.

In SM-BC, you will create a primary and destination consistency group for replication and data protection. The destination consistency group will serve your data in the event of a disruption. 

To learn more about consistency groups, refer to link:../consistency-groups/index.html[Consistency groups overview].

.Constituent

An individual volume that is part of a consistency group.

.Mediator

The ONTAP Mediators monitors the two ONTAP clusters and orchestrates failover in case your primary storage system fails. With ONTAP Mediator, your application automatically reconnects to the resources in the secondary storage system. 

With the Mediator's health information, clusters can differentiate between intercluster LIF failure and site failure. When the site goes down, Mediator passes on the health information to the peer cluster on demand, facilitating the peer cluster to failover.

.Planned failover

A manual operation to change the roles of copies in a SM-BC relationship. The primary sites becomes the secondary, and the secondary becomes the primary.

.Automatic unplanned failover (AUFO)

An automatic operation to perform a failover to the mirror copy. The operation requires assistance from Mediator to detect that the primary copy is unavailable.

.Out of Sync (OOS)

When the application I/O is not replicating to the secondary storage system, it will be reported as **out of sync**. An out of sync status means the destination volumes are not synchronized with the source and that SnapMirror replication is not occurring. 

If the mirror state is `Snapmirrored`, this indicates a transfer failure or failure due to an unsupported operation.

.Zero RPO

Zero recovery point objective. This is the acceptable amount of data loss from downtime.

.Zero RTO

Zero recovery time objective.

Transparent Application Failover is achieved by using host multipath I/O (MPIO) software-based path failover to provide non-disruptive access to the storage.
