[.lead]
Adding and removing volumes in an active SM-BC relationship depends on the version of ONTAP you are using. 

.About this task
In ONTAP 9.8 through 9.9.1, you can add or remove volumes to a consistency group using the ONTAP CLI. 

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, it is recommended that you manage link:../consistency-groups/index.html[consistency groups] through System Manager or with the ONTAP REST API. If you want to change the composition of the consistency group by adding or removing a volume, you must first delete the original relationship and then create the consistency group again with the new composition.

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can non-disruptively add volumes to a consistency group with an active SM-BC relationship from the source or destination.

[NOTE]
Removing volumes from a consistency group with an SM-BC relationship is disruptive and you must break the SnapMirror relationship before proceeding with this operation.

.Before you begin

* The composition change is not allowed when the consistency group is in the “InSync” state.
* The destination volume should be of type DP.
* The new volume you add to expand the consistency group must have a pair of common Snapshot copies between the source and destination volumes.

.Steps

This procedure assumes that there are two volume mappings: vol_src1 <--> vol_dst1 and vol_src2 <--> vol_dst2, in a consistency group relationship between the end points vs1_src:/cg/cg_src and vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst.

. Verify that a common Snapshot copy exists between the source and destination volumes on both the source and destination cluster:
+
`source::>snapshot show -vserver vs1_src -volume vol_src3 -snapshot snapmirror*`
+
`destination::>snapshot show -vserver vs1_dst -volume vol_dst3 -snapshot snapmirror*`

. If no common Snapshot copy exists, create and initialize a FlexVol SnapMirror relationship:
+
`destination::>snapmirror initialize -source-path vs1_src:vol_src3 -destination-path vs1_dst:vol_dst3`

. Delete the zero RTO consistency group relationship:
+
`destination::>snapmirror delete -destination-path vs1_dst:vol_dst3`

. Release the source SnapMirror relationship and retain the common Snapshot copies:
+
`source::>snapmirror release -relationship-info-only true -destination-path vs1_dst:vol_dst3`

. Unmap the LUNs and delete the existing consistency group relationship:
+
`destination::>lun mapping delete -vserver vs1_dst -path <lun_path> -igroup <igroup_name>`
+
NOTE: The destination LUNs are unmapped, while the LUNs on the primary copy continue to serve the host I/O.
+
`destination::>snapmirror delete -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`
+
`source::>snapmirror release -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst -relationship-info-only true`

. **If you are using ONTAP 9.10.1 through 9.13.0,** delete and recreate and the consistency group on the source with the correct composition. Follow the steps in xref:../consistency-groups/delete-task.html[Delete a consistency group] and then xref:../consistency-groups/configure-task.html[Configure a single consistency group]. In ONTAP 9.10.1 and later, you must perform the delete and create operations in System Manager or with the ONTAP REST API; there is no CLI procedure.
+
**If you are using ONTAP 9.8, 9.0, or 9.9.1, skip to the next step.**

. Create the new consistency group on the destination with the new composition:
+
`destination::>snapmirror create -source-path vs1_src:/cg/cg_src -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst -cg-item-mappings vol_src1:@vol_dst1, vol_src2:@vol_dst2, vol_src3:@vol_dst3`

. Resynchronize the zero RTO consistency group relationship to ensure it is in sync:
+
`destination::>snapmirror resync -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`

. Remap the LUNs that you unmapped in Step 5:
+
`destination::> lun map -vserver vs1_dst -path _lun_path_ -igroup _igroup_name_`

. Rescan host LUN I/O paths to restore all paths to the LUNs.

.ONTAP 9.13.1 and later
--
Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can non-disruptively add volumes to a consistency group with an active SM-BC relationship. SM-BC supports adding volumes from both the source or destination. 

For details on adding volumes from the source consistency group, see xref:../consistency-groups/modify-task.html[Modify a consistency group].

.Add a volume from the destination cluster
. On the destination cluster, select **Protection** > **Relationships**. 
. Find the SM-BC relationship you want to add volumes to. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[kebab icon] then **Expand**. 
. Select the volume relationships whose volumes are to be added to consistency group
. Select **Expand**.
