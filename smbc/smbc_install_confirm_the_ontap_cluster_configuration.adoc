You should make sure that your source and destination clusters are configured properly.

.About this task

Proceed through each of the following steps. For each step, you should confirm that the specific configuration has been performed. Use the link included after each step to get more information as needed.

.Steps

. Install the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/mediator/mediator-task-install-ontap-mediator.html [ONTAP Mediator service^] before you ensure that your source and destination clusters are configured properly.

. Confirm that a cluster peering relationship exists between the clusters.
+
NOTE: The default IPspace is required by SM-BC for cluster peer relationships. Custom IPspace is not supported.
