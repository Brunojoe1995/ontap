[.lead]
There are several prerequisites that you should consider as part of planning a SnapMirror Business Continuity solution deployment.

== Hardware

* Only two-node HA clusters are supported
* Both clusters must be either AFF or ASA (no mixing)

== Software
* ONTAP 9.8 or later
* ONTAP Mediator 1.2 or later
* A Linux server or virtual machine for the ONTAP Mediator running one of the following:

include::../_include/mediator-linux-support.adoc[]

== Licensing

* SnapMirror synchronous (SM-S) license must be applied on both clusters
* SnapMirror license must be applied on both clusters
+
[NOTE]
If your ONTAP storage systems were purchased before June 2019, see link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/systems/master-license-keys[NetApp ONTAP Master License Keys^] to get the required SM-S license.

== Networking environment

* Inter-cluster latency round trip time (RTT) must be less than 10 milliseconds
* SCSI-3 persistent reservations are **not** supported with SM-BC 

== Supported protocols

* Only SAN protocols are supported (not NFS/SMB)
* Only Fibre Channel and iSCSI protocols are supported
* The default IPspace is required by SM-BC for cluster peer relationships. Custom IPspace is not supported.

== NTFS Security Style

NTFS security style is *not* supported on SM-BC volumes.

== ONTAP Mediator

* Must be provisioned externally and attached to ONTAP for transparent application failover.
* For more information about the ONTAP Mediator, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/task_configuring_the_ontap_mediator_service_from_a_metrocluster_ip_configuration.html[Prepare to install the ONTAP Mediator service^].

== Read-write destination volumes

* SM-BC relationships are not supported on read-write destination volumes. Before you can use a read-write volume, you must convert it to a DP volume by creating a volume-level SnapMirror relationship and then deleting the relationship. For details, see link:smbc_admin_converting_existing_relationships_to_smbc.html[Converting existing relationships to SM-BC relationships]

== Large LUNs and large volumes

* Large LUNs and large volumes greater than 100TB are supported only on All SAN Arrays

[NOTE]
You must ensure that both the primary and secondary cluster are All SAN Arrays, and that they both have ONTAP 9.8 or later installed. If the secondary cluster is running a version earlier than ONTAP 9.8 or if it is not an All SAN Array, the synchronous relationship can go out of sync if the primary volume grows larger than 100 TB.
