.Issue:

Creation of SnapMirror relationship and consistency group initialization fails.

.Solution:

If you are using ONTAP 9.8 or 9.9. ensure that the configuration has no more than 5 consistency groups. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, the limit is 20. See link:smbc_plan_additional_restrictions_and_limitations.html[Additional restrictions and limitations].

.Error:
If the consistency group is stuck initializing, check the status of your consistency group initializations with the ONTAP REST API, System Manager or the command `sn show -expand`.

.Solution:
If consistency groups fail to initialize, remove the SM-BC relationship, delete the consistency group, then recreate the relationship and initialize it. This workflow differs depending on the version of ONTAP you are using.
