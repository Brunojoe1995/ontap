.Steps

. Install the ONTAP Mediator service before you ensure that your source and destination clusters are configured properly.

. Confirm that a cluster peering relationship exists between the clusters.
+
NOTE: The default IPspace is required by SM-BC for cluster peer relationships. Custom IPspace is not supported.
