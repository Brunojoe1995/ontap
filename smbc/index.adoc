[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) to protect applications with LUNs, enabling applications to fail over transparently, ensuring business continuity in case of a disaster. SM-BC is supported on AFF clusters (including AFF C-Series) or All SAN Array (ASA) clusters, where the primary and secondary clusters can be either AFF or ASA. SM-BC protects applications with iSCSI or FCP LUNs.

== Benefits

SnapMirror Business Continuity provides the following benefits:

* Provides continuous availability for business-critical applications
* Ability to host critical applications alternately from primary and secondary site
* Simplified application management using consistency groups for dependent write-order consistency
* The ability to test failover for each application
* Instantaneous creation of mirror clones without impacting application availability
* Beginning in ONTAP 9.11.1, SM-BC supports xref:../data-protection/restore-single-file-snapshot-task.html[single-file SnapRestore]. 

== Typical use cases

=== Application deployment for zero RTO or Transparent Application Failover

Transparent Application Failover is based on host multipath I/O (MPIO) software-based path failover to achieve non-disruptive access to the storage. Both LUN copies, for example, primary(L1P) and mirror copy(L1S), have the same identity (serial number) and are reported as read-writable to the host. However, reads and writes are serviced only by the primary volume. I/Os issued to the mirror copy are proxied to the primary copy. The host's preferred path to L1 is VS1:N1 based on Asymmetric Logical Unit Access (ALUA) access state Active Optimized (A/O). Mediator is recommended as part of the deployment, primarily to perform failover in case of a storage outage on the primary.

=== Disaster scenario

The site hosting the primary cluster experiences a disaster. Host multipathing software marks all paths through the cluster as down and uses paths from the secondary cluster. The result is a non-disruptive failover to the mirror copy for LUN L1. L1S is converted from a mirror copy to an active copy of LUN L1. The failover happens automatically when an external Mediator is configured. The host's preferred path to L1 becomes VS2:N1.

== Architecture
