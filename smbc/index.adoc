[.lead]
SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) enables business services to continue operating even through a complete site failure, supporting applications to fail over transparently using a secondary copy. Neither manual intervention nor additional scripting is required to trigger a failover with SM-BC. 

SM-BC is available beginning with ONTAP 9.8. SM-BC is supported on AFF clusters or All SAN Array (ASA) clusters, where the primary and secondary clusters can be either AFF or ASA. SM-BC protects applications with iSCSI or FCP LUNs.

== Benefits

SM-BC provides the following benefits:

* Continuous availability for business-critical applications
* Ability to host critical applications alternately from primary and secondary site
* Simplified application management using consistency groups for dependent write-order consistency
* The ability to test failover for each application
* Instantaneous creation of mirror clones without impacting application availability
* Beginning in ONTAP 9.11.1, SM-BC supports xref:../data-protection/restore-single-file-snapshot-task.html[single-file SnapRestore]. 
* You are entitled to use SM-BC if you have the data protection or one-time premium bundle on both the source and destination storage clusters.

== Use cases

=== Application deployment for zero recovery time object (RTO) or Transparent Application Failover

In an SM-BC deployment, you will have a source and destination cluster. A LUN in source (`1LP`) will have a mirror (`L1s`) on the destination; both LUNs share the same serial ID and are reported as read-write LUNs to the host. Read and write operations, however, are only serviced to the source LUN, `1LP`. Any writes to the mirror `L1S` are served by proxy. 

SM-BC offers transparent application failover (TAF), which is based on host multipath I/O (MPIO) software-based path failover to achieve non-disruptive access to the storage.

With TAF, 


Both LUN copies, for example, primary (L1P) and mirror copy (L1S), have the same identity (serial number) and are reported as read-writable to the host. However, reads and writes are serviced only by the primary volume. I/Os issued to the mirror copy are proxied to the primary copy. The host's preferred path to L1 is VS1:N1 based on Asymmetric Logical Unit Access (ALUA) access state Active Optimized (A/O). Mediator is recommended as part of the deployment, primarily to perform failover in case of a storage outage on the primary.

=== Disaster scenario

With SM-BC, you can synchronously replicate multiple volumes for an application (by adding them to a consistency group) between sites at geographically dispersed locations. And you can automatically failover to the secondary copy in case of disruption of the primary, thus, enabling business continuity for tier one applications


== Architecture

The following figure illustrates the operation of the SnapMirror Business Continuity feature at a high level.

image:workflow_san_snapmirror_business_continuity.png[SnapMirror Business Continuity workflow]

In section one of the diagram, an application is deployed on a SVM in the primary data center. The volumes that have been added to the primary consistency group are protected with SM-BC and are mirrored to destination consistency group at a secondary data center. The volumes in the primary consistency group will failover to the mirrored consistency group in the event of a disruption. Volumes not in a mirrored consistency group are not served. 

== Using SM-BC

You can manage SM-BC using the System Manager, the ONTAP CLI, and the ONTAP REST API. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, ONTAP offers an xref:../consistency-groups/index.html[consistency group] management experience that help you manage your SM-BC consistency groups with the REST API or System Manager.

== Key concepts

As you begin to explore the ONTAP SnapMirror Business Continuity and plan a deployment, it is helpful to become familiar with the key terminology and concepts.

.SM-BC

Acronym for the SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) solution available with ONTAP 9.8 and later.

.Consistency group

[Note]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, consistency groups have become a first-order management unit. To learn more about consistency groups, refer to link:../consistency-groups/index.html[Consistency groups overview].

A consistency group (CG) is a collection of FlexVol volumes that provide a write order consistency guarantee for the application workload which needs to be protected for business continuity. The purpose of a consistency group is to take simultaneous crash-consistent Snapshot copies of a collection of volumes at a point in time. In regular deployment, the group of volumes picked to be part of a CG are mapped to an application instance. SnapMirror relationships, also known as a CG relationship, is established between a source CG and a destination CG. The source and destination CGs must contain the same number and type of volumes.

.Constituent

The individual volumes that are part of a consistency group.

.Mediator

ONTAP Mediator provides an alternate health path to the peer cluster, with the intercluster LIFs providing the other health path. With the Mediator's health information, clusters can differentiate between intercluster LIF failure and site failure. When the site goes down, Mediator passes on the health information to the peer cluster on demand, facilitating the peer cluster to fail over. With the Mediator-provided information and the intercluster LIF health check information, ONTAP determines whether to perform an auto failover, if it is failover incapable, continue or stop.

Mediator is one of three parties in the SM-BC quorum, working with the primary cluster and the secondary cluster to reach a consensus. A consensus requires at least two parties in the quorum to agree to an operation.

.Out of Sync (OOS)

The application I/O is not replicating to the secondary storage system. The destination volume is not in sync with the source volume because SnapMirror replication is not occuring. If the mirror state is Snapmirrored, this indicates a transfer failure or failure due to an unsupported operation.

.Zero RPO

Zero recovery point objective. This is the acceptable amount of data loss from downtime.

.Zero RTO

Zero recovery time objective or Transparent Application Failover is achieved by using host multipath I/O (MPIO) software-based path failover to provide non-disruptive access to the storage.

.Planned failover

A manual operation to change the roles of copies in a SM-BC relationship. The primary becomes the secondary and the secondary becomes the primary. ALUA reporting also changes.

.Automatic unplanned failover (AUFO)

An automatic operation to perform a failover to the mirror copy. The operation requires assistance from Mediator to detect that the primary copy is unavailable.
