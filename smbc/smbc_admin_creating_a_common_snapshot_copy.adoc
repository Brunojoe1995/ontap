In addition to the regularly scheduled Snapshot copy operations, you can manually create a common Snapshot copy between the volumes in the primary SnapMirror consistency group and the volumes in the secondary SnapMirror consistency group.

In ONTAP 9.8, the scheduled snapshot creation interval is one hour. Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, that interval is 12 hours.  

.Before you begin

The SnapMirror group relationship must be in sync.

.Steps

+
`destination::>snapmirror update -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`

. Monitor the progress of the update:
+
`destination::>snapmirror show -fields -newest-snapshot`
