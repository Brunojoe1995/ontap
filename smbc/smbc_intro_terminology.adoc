As you begin to explore the ONTAP SnapMirror Business Continuity and plan a deployment, it is helpful to become familiar with the key terminology and concepts.

.Consistency group

A consistency group (CG) is a management unit of volumes that provide a write order consistency guarantee for the application workload that needs to be protected for business continuity. The purpose of a consistency group is to take simultaneous crash-consistent Snapshot copies of a collection of volumes at a point in time. Consistency groups are management units for the volumes in SM-BC relationships.

To learn more about consistency groups, refer to link:../consistency-groups/index.html[Consistency groups overview].

.Constituent

An individual volume that is part of a consistency group. A constituent is mirrored to a remote site. 

.ONTAP Mediator

The ONTAP Mediator provides an alternate health path to the peer cluster, with the intercluster LIFs providing the other health path. With the ONTAP Mediator's health information, clusters can differentiate between intercluster LIF failure and site failure. When the site goes down, the mediator passes on the health information to the peer cluster on demand, facilitating the peer cluster to fail over. With the mediator-provided information and the intercluster LIF health check information, ONTAP determines whether to perform an auto failover, if it is failover incapable, continue or stop.

The ONTAP Mediator is one of three parties in the SM-BC quorum, working with the primary cluster and the secondary cluster to reach a consensus. A consensus requires at least two parties in the quorum to agree to an operation.

.Out of Sync (OOS)

The application I/O is not replicating to the secondary storage system. The destination volume is not in sync with the source volume because SnapMirror replication is not occuring. If the mirror state is Snapmirrored, this indicates a transfer failure or failure due to an unsupported operation.

.Zero RPO

Zero recovery point objective (RPO). RPO is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss during an outage, failure, or other disaster scenario. RPO is measured in time (for example, minutes or seconds). Zero RPO refers to a situation where no data loss is acceptable, even in the event of an outage. 

.Zero RTO

Zero recovery time objective or Transparent Application Failover is achieved by using host multipath I/O (MPIO) software-based path failover to provide non-disruptive access to the storage.

.Planned failover

A manual operation to change the roles of copies in a SM-BC relationship. The primary becomes the secondary and the secondary becomes the primary. ALUA reporting also changes.

.Automatic unplanned failover (AUFO)

An automatic operation to perform a failover to the mirror copy. The operation requires assistance from Mediator to detect that the primary copy is unavailable.
