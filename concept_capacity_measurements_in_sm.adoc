Using System Manager, you can view how much storage capacity has been used and how much is still available for a cluster.  Also, beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can use System Manager to view historical data about the cluster’s capacity and projections about how much capacity will be used or available in the future.

[[cap-measurements-sm]]
== Capacity measurements in System Manager

System capacity can be measured as physical space or logical space. Recent versions of System Manager use measurements of both physical and logical capacity.

The differences between the two measurements are explained in the following descriptions:

* *Physical capacity*:  Physical space refers to the physical blocks of storage used in the volume. The value for physical used capacity is typically smaller than the value for logical used capacity due to the reduction of data from storage efficiency features (such as deduplication and compression).

* *Logical capacity*: Logical space refers to the usable space (the logical blocks) in a volume. Logical space refers to how theoretical space can be used, without accounting for results of deduplication or compression.  The value for logical space used is derived from the amount of physical space used plus the savings from storage efficiency features (such as deduplication and compression) that have been configured.  This measurement often appears larger than the physical used capacity because it includes Snapshot copies, clones, and other components, and it does not reflect the data compression and other reductions in the physical space. Thus, the total logical capacity could be higher than the provisioned space.

NOTE: In System Manager, capacity representations do not account for root storage tier (aggregate) capacities.

[[measurements-used-cap]]
== Measurements of used capacity

Measurements of used capacity are displayed differently depending on the version of System Manager you are using, as explained in the following table:

[cols="30,30,40"]
|===

h| Version of System Manager h| Term used for capacity  h| Type of capacity referred to

a|9.5 and 9.6
(Classic view)
a|Used
a|Physical space used

a|9.7 and 9.8
a|Used
a|Logical space used
(if storage efficiency settings have been enabled)

a|9.9.1 and later
a|Logical Used
a|Logical space used
(if storage efficiency settings have been enabled)

[[measurement-terms]]
== Measurement terms
The following terms are used when describing capacity:

* *Physical used*: Displays the amount of capacity used in the physical blocks of a volume.
* *Physical used %*: Displays the percentage of capacity used in the physical blocks of a volume compared to the provisioned size.
* *Logical used*: Displays the amount of used space without considering the space saved by storage efficiency features.
* *Logical used %*: Displays the percentage of the current logical used capacity compared to the provisioned size, excluding the Snapshot reserve of the volume.  This value can be greater than 100%, because it includes efficiency savings in the volume.

[[cap-measurement-units]]
== Capacity measurement units
System Manager calculates storage capacity based on binary units of 1024 (2^10^) bytes.  In ONTAP 9.10.0 and earlier, these units were displayed in System Manager as KB, MB, GB, TB, and PB.  Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, they are displayed in System Manager as KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, and PiB.

NOTE:  The units used in System Manager for throughput continue to be KB/s, MB/s, GB/s, TB/s, and PB/s for all releases of ONTAP.

[[view-cap-measurements]]
== View capacity measurements for the cluster

You can view capacity measurements for the cluster on the Dashboard in System Manager.

.Before you begin

To view data related to the capacity in the cloud, you must have an account with Active IQ Digital Advisor and be connected.

.Steps

. In System Manager, click *Dashboard*.

. In the *Capacity* section, you can view the following:
+
* Total used capacity of the cluster
* Total available capacity of the cluster
* Percentages of used and available capacity.
* Ratio of data reduction.
* Amount of capacity used in the cloud.
* History of capacity usage.
* Projection of capacity usage

. Click image:../media/icon_arrow.gif[right arrow] to view more details about the capacity of the cluster.
