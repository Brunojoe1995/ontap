== MetroCluster 

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| New MetroCluster features
| SnapMirror data protection now supports SnapLock for archiving compliance support.
| MetroCluster IP support for end-to-end encryption
| https://review.docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster_aoife-mcc-9151/install-ip/task-configure-end-to-end-encryption.html#enable-end-to-end-encryption[End-to-end encryption] is now supported on AFF A400, FAS8300, and FAS8700 systems to encrypt back-end traffic, NVLog storage replication data, and sites in a MetroCluster IP configuration.
| Volume limit increase for four-node MetroCluster IP configurations on AFF A800 and AFF C800 systems
| In four-node MetroCluster IP configurations, the volume limits for AFF A800 and AFF C800 systems have been increased.
| Volume limit increase for four-node MetroCluster IP configurations on AFF A900 systems.
| In four-node MetroCluster IP configurations, the volume limits for AFF A900 systems have been increased.

== Performance Enhancements

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description
| FlexCache writeback support
| When https://review.docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap_ontap-9151/flexcache/flexcache-writeback-enable-task.html[writeback is enabled] on a cache volume, write requests are sent to the local cache instead of the origin volume, providing better performance for edge computing environments with caches for write-heavy workloads.
| Performance enhancement for file system analytics
| ONTAP now enforces keeping 5-8% of a volume's capacity free before https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_nas_file_system_analytics_enable.html[enabling file system analytics], mitigating potential performance issues on volumes with file system analytics.
| Performance enhancements in System Manager dashboard
| The information in the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_cp_dashboard_tour.html[System Manager dashboard] for health, capacity, network, and performance views now includes complete descriptions, including enhancements to performance metrics to help identify and troubleshoot latency and performance issues.

== Security  

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| ONTAP supports dynamic authorization for SSH connections
| ONTAP 9.15.1 provides an initial framework for https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/dynamic-authorization-overview.html[dynamic authorization], which provides enhanced security management for the ONTAP system by enabling the assignment of a security trust score to administrator users and challenging them with additional authorization checks if their activity looks suspicious. This feature is part of utilizing a dynamic authorization data-centric zero trust security architecture.
| ONTAP supports TLS 1.3 for S3 storage, FlexCache, and cluster peering encryption
| TLS 1.3 is now supported in ONTAP 9.15.1 for S3 storage, FlexCache, and cluster peering encryption.
| Eligible set of rule-protected commands extended for multi-admin verification
| Administrators can now create https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/multi-admin-verify/index.html#rule-protected-commands[multi-admin verification rules] to protect cluster configuration, LUN deletion, system configuration, security configuration with IPSec and SAML, volume snapshot creation, and Vserver configuration.
| Support for NFSv3 with RDMA
| https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nfs-rdma/[NFS RDMA] configurations now support NFSv3
| FPolicy supports NFS 4.1 protocol
| FPolicy now supports the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nas-audit/supported-file-operation-filter-fpolicy-nfsv4-concept.html[NFS 4.1 protocol], with Protobuf as Google's language-neutral mechanism for serializing structured data, which is smaller, faster, and simpler compared to XML and helps improve FPolicy performance.
