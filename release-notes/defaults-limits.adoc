= Changes to ONTAP limits and defaults

[.lead]
Learn about some of the changes to limits and defaults implemented in ONTAP 9 releases. NetApp strives to help its customers understand the most important limits that change with each ONTAP release.

== ONTAP defaults

[cols="25%,50%,25%",options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Default change | Changed in release…
| `vserver object-store-server user show` command
| In releases prior to ONTAP 9.15.1, the `vserver object-store-server user show` command would return the S3 user's secret keys. The command will no longer return secret key data for S3 users.
| ONTAP 9.15.1

| NAS audit
| NAS audit configuration allows retaining all audit log records by default. A revised value for the rotate-limit parameter ensures the audit log is sized properly for the volume supporting it.
| ONTAP 9.15.1

| Space allocation
| Space allocation is enabled by default for newly created VMware and Hyper-V LUNs and is disabled for all newly created LUNs not used by VMware and Hyper-V.
| ONTAP 9.15.1

| NVMe/TCP automated host discovery
| Host discovery of controllers using the NVMe/TCP protocol is automated by default.
| ONTAP 9.14.1

| AES encryption for Kerberos-based communication
| AES encryption for authentication is enabled by default for Kerberos-based communication with SMB servers. You can disable AES encryption manually if your environment does not support it.
| ONTAP 9.13.1

| RAID aggregate
| Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, the system will not shut down by default after 24 hours if any aggregate is degraded. If a user changes the `raid.timeout` option, the system will continue to shut down after the expiration of `raid.timeout` hours.
| 9.12.1

| TLS 1.1 disabled by default
| TLS 1.1 is disabled by default for new installations of ONTAP. Systems that are upgraded to ONTAP 9.12.0 and later that already have TLS 1.1 enabled are not affected as the upgrade will leave TLS 1.1 in an enabled state. When disabled by default, TLS 1.1 can be manually enabled as needed.
| ONTAP 9.12.0

| TLS 1.0 disabled by default
| TLS 1.0 is disabled by default for new installations of ONTAP. Systems that are upgraded to ONTAP 9.8 and later that already have TLS 1.0 enabled are not affected as the upgrade will leave TLS 1.0 in an enabled state. When disabled by default, TLS 1.0 can be manually enabled as needed.
| ONTAP 9.8

[cols="25%,50%,25%",options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Limit change | Changed in release…
| SnapMirror active sync: symmetric active/active
| SnapMirror active sync supports 80 volumes in a consistency group

| SnapMirror
asynchronous
| Consistency groups using SnapMirror asynchronous protection support up to 80 volumes in a consistency group.
| ONTAP 9.15.1

| File System Analytics
| To mitigate performance issues, ONTAP enforces that 5-8% of a volume's capacity must be free when enabling File System Analytics.
| ONTAP 9.15.1

| SVM data mobility
| The maximum number of supported volumes per SVM with SVM data mobility increases to 400 and the number of supported HA pairs increases to 12.
| ONTAP 9.14.1

| FlexVol and FlexGroup volume size limit
| The maximum supported FlexVol and FlexGroup volume constituent size on AFF and FAS platforms is increased from 100 TB to 300 TB.
| ONTAP 9.12.1P2

| LUN size limit
| The maximum supported LUN size on AFF and FAS platforms is increased from 16 TB to 128 TB. The maximum supported LUN size in SnapMirror configurations (Synchronous and Asynchronous) is increased from 16 TB to 128 TB.
| ONTAP 9.12.1P2

| FlexVol volume size limit
| The maximum supported volume size on AFF and FAS platforms is increased from 100 TB to 300 TB. The maximum supported FlexVol volume size in SnapMirror Synchronous configurations is increased from 100 TB to 300 TB.
| ONTAP 9.12.1P2

| File size limit
| The maximum supported file size for NAS file systems on AFF and FAS platforms is increased from 16 TB to 128 TB. The maximum supported file size in SnapMirror Synchronous configurations is increased from 16 TB to 128 TB.
| ONTAP 9.12.1P2

| Cluster volume limit
| Increase the ability for controllers to more fully utilize CPU and memory and increase maximum volume count for a cluster from 15,000 to 30,000.
| ONTAP 9.12.1

| SVM-DR relationships for FlexVol volumes
| For FlexVol volumes, the maximum number of SVM-DR relationships has increased from 64 to 128 (128 SVMs per cluster).
| ONTAP 9.11.1

| SnapMirror Synchronous
| The maximum number of SnapMirror Synchronous operations allowed per HA pair has increased from 200 to 400.
| ONTAP 9.11.1

| NAS FlexVol volumes
| The cluster limit for NAS FlexVol volumes has increased from 12k to 15k.
| ONTAP 9.10.1

| SAN FlexVol volumes
| The cluster limit for SAN FlexVol volumes has increased from 12k to 15k.
| ONTAP 9.10.1

| SVM-DR with FlexGroup volumes
a| * A maximum of 32 SVM-DR relationships is supported with FlexGroup volumes.
* The maximum number of volumes supported in a single SVM in an SVM-DR relationship is 300, which includes the number of FlexVol volumes and FlexGroup constituents.
* The maximum number of constituents in a FlexGroup cannot exceed 20.
* SVM-DR volume limits are 500 per node, 1000 per Cluster (including FlexVol volumes and FlexGroup constituents).
| ONTAP 9.10.1 

| Auditing-enabled SVMs
| The maximum number of auditing-enabled SVMs supported in a cluster has been increased from 50 to 400.

| The maximum number of supported SnapMirror Synchronous endpoints per HA pair has increased from 80 to 160.
| ONTAP 9.9.1

| FlexGroup SnapMirror topology
| FlexGroup volumes support two or more fanout relationships; for example, A to B, A to C. Like FlexVol volumes, FlexGroup fanout supports a maximum of 8 fanout legs and cascading up to two-levels; for example, A to B to C.
| ONTAP 9.9.1

| SnapMirror concurrent transfer
| The maximum number of asynchronous volume-level SnapMirror concurrent transfers has increased from 100 to 200. Cloud-to-cloud SnapMirror transfers has increased from 32 to 200 on high-end systems and from 6 to 20 SnapMirror transfers on low-end systems.
