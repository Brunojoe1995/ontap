== ONTAP 9.13.1 highlights

* xref:../authentication/grant-access-active-directory-users-groups-task.html[SSH public key authentication with Active Directory]
+
Use an SSH public key as your primary authentication method with an Active Directory (AD) user or as your secondary authentication method after an AD user.
* xref:../authentication/setup-ssh-multifactor-authentication-task.html#enable-mfa-with-totp[Multifactor authentication with TOTP (time-based one-time passwords)]
+
Set up local user accounts with multifactor authentication using a time-based one-time password (TOTP). The TOTP is always used as the second authentication method.
* xref:../nas-audit/create-fpolicy-event-task.html[FPolicy file access failure notification]
+
FPolicy supports notifications for access denied events. Notifications are generated for file operation failed due to lack of permission, which includes: failure due to NTFS permissions, failure due to Unix mode bits, and failure due to NFSv4 ACLs.
* xref:../s3-config/create-bucket-lifecycle-rule-task.html[S3 bucket lifecycle management]
+
S3 object expiration actions define when objects in a bucket expire. This capability enables you to manage object versions so you can meet retention requirements and manage overall S3 object storage effectively.

For a full list of new features and enhancements, see xref:9131-reference.adoc[What's new in ONTAP 9.13.1].

== ONTAP 9.12.1 highlights 

* xref:../snaplock/snapshot-lock-concept.html[Tamper-proof Snapshots]
+
With SnapLock technology, Snapshot copies can now be protected from deletion on either the source or destination.
+
Retain more recovery points by protecting snapshots on primary and secondary storage from deletion by ransomware attackers or rogue administrators.

* xref:../anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous ransomware protection (ARP) enhancements]
+
Immediately enable intelligent autonomous ransomware protection on secondary storage, based on the screening model already completed for the primary storage. 
+
After a failover, instantly identify potential ransomware attacks on secondary storage. A Snapshot is immediately taken of the data that is starting to be affected, and administrators are notified, helping to stop an attack and enhance recovery. 
* xref:../nas-audit/plan-fpolicy-event-config-concept.html[FPolicy]
+
One-click activation of ONTAP FPolicy to enable automatic blocking of known malicious files The simplified activation helps to protect against typical ransomware attacks that use common, known file extensions.
* xref:../system-admin/ontap-implements-audit-logging-concept.html[Security hardening: Tamper-proof retention logging]
+
Tamperproof retention logging in ONTAP insuring compromised administrator accounts cannot hide malicious actions. Admin and user history cannot be altered or deleted without the systems knowledge. 
+
Log and audit all admin actions regardless of origin guaranteeing all actions impacting data are captured. An alert is generated whenever system audit logs have been tampered with in any way notifying administrators of the change.
* xref:../authentication/setup-ssh-multifactor-authentication-task.html[Security hardening: Expanded multifactor authentication]
+
Multifactor authentication (MFA) for CLI (SSH) supports Yubikey physical hardware token devices ensuring that an attacker cannot access the ONTAP system using stolen credentials or a compromised client system. Cisco DUO is now supported for MFA with System Manager.
* File-object duality (multi-protocol access)
+
File-object duality enables native S3 protocol read and write access to the same data source that already has NAS protocol access. You can concurrently access your storage as files or as objects from the same data source, eliminating the need for duplicate copies of data for use with different protocols (S3 or NAS), such as for analytics that use object data.
* xref:../flexgroup/manage-flexgroup-rebalance-task.html[FlexGroup rebalancing]
+
In the event FlexGroup constituents become unbalanced, FlexGroup can now nondisruptively be rebalanced and managed from
CLI, REST API, and System Manager. For optimal performance, constituent members within a FlexGroup should have their used capacity evenly distributed.
* Storage capacity enhancements
+
WAFL Space Reservation has been significantly reduced, providing up to 400 TiB more usable capacity per aggregate.

== ONTAP 9.11.1 highlights 

* xref:../multi-admin-verify/index.html[Multi-admin verification]
+
Multi-admin verification (MAV) is an industry-first native approach to verification, requiring multiple approvals for sensitive administrative tasks such as deleting a Snapshot or volume. The approvals required in a MAV implementation prevent malicious attacks and accidental changes to data.

* xref:../anti-ransomware/index.html[Enhancements to Autonomous Ransomware Protection]
+
Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) uses machine learning to detect ransomware threats with increased granularity, enabling you to identify threats quickly and accelerate recovery in the event of a breach. 

* xref:../flexgroup/supported-unsupported-config-concept.html#features-supported-beginning-with-ontap-9-11-1[SnapLock Compliance for FlexGroup volumes]
+
Secure multi-petabyte datasets for workloads such as electronic design automation and media & entertainment by protecting the data with WORM file locking so it cannot be changed or deleted.

* Asynchronous directory delete
+
With ONTAP 9.11.1, file deletion occurs in the background of the ONTAP system, enabling you to easily delete large directories while eliminating performance and latency impacts on the host I/O. 

* xref:../s3-config/index.html[S3 enhancements]
+
Simplify and expand the object data management capabilities of S3 with ONTAP with additional API endpoints and object versioning at the bucket level, enabling multiple versions of an object to be stored in the same bucket. 

* System Manager enhancements
+
System Manager now supports advanced capabilities to optimize storage resources and improve audit management. These updates include enhanced abilities to manage and configure storage aggregates, enhanced visibility into system analytics, hardware visualization for FAS systems.

For a full list of new features and enhancements, see xref:9111-reference.adoc[What's new in ONTAP 9.11.1].

== ONTAP 9.10.1 highlights 

* xref:../anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection]
+
Autonomous Ransomware Protection automatically creates a Snapshot copy of your volume and alerts administrators when abnormal activity is detected, enabling you to quickly detect ransomware attacks and recover more quickly. 

* System Manager enhancements
+
System Manager automatically download fimrware updates for disks, shelves, service processors in addition to providing new integrations with NetApp Active IQ Digital Advisor, BlueXP, and certificate management. These enhancements simplify administration and maintain business continuity. 

* xref:../concept_nas_file_system_analytics_overview.html[File System Analytics enhancements]
+
File System Analytics provides additional telemetry to identify top files, directories, and users in your file share, enabling you to identify workload performance issues to improve resource planning and implementation of QoS.

* xref:../nvme/support-limitations.html[NVMe over TCP (NVMe/TCP) support for AFF systems]
+
Achieve high performance and reduce TCO for your enterprise SAN and modern workloads on AFF system when you use NVMe/TCP on your existing Ethernet network.

* xref:../nvme/support-limitations.html[NVMe over Fibre Channel (NVMe/FC) support for NetApp FAS systems]
+
Use the NVMe/FC protocol on your hybrid arrays to enable uniform migration to NVMe. 

* xref:../s3-snapmirror/index.html[Native hybrid cloud backup for object storage]
+
Protect your ONTAP S3 data with your choice of object storage targets. Use SnapMirror replication to back up to on-premises storage with StorageGrid, to the cloud with Amazon S3, or to another ONTAP S3 buck on NetApp AFF and FAS systems.

* xref:../flexcache/global-file-locking-task.html[Global file-locking with FlexCache]
+
Ensure file consistency at cache locations during updates to source files at the origin with global file-locking using FlexCache. This enhancement enables exclusive file-read locks in an origin-to-cache relationship for workloads that require enhanced locking.
