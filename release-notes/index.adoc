| ONTAP Version | Highlights 
| xref:9131-reference.adoc[ONTAP 9.13.1]
a|
* xref:../authentication/grant-access-active-directory-users-groups-task.html[SSH public key authentication with Active Directory]
* xref:../authentication/setup-ssh-multifactor-authentication-task.html#enable-mfa-with-totp[Multifactor authentication with TOTP (time-based one-time passwords)]
* xref:../nas-audit/create-fpolicy-event-task.html[FPolicy file access failure notification]
* xref:../s3-config/create-bucket-lifecycle-rule-task.html[S3 bucket lifecycle management]
* xref:../volumes/enable-temperature-sensitive-efficiency-concept.html[Temperature-sensitive storage efficiency]
| xref:9121-reference.adoc[ONTAP 9.12.1]
a| 
* xref:../snaplock/snapshot-lock-concept.html[Tamper-proof Snapshots]
+
With SnapLock technology, Snapshot copies can now be protected from deletion on either the source or destination.
+
Retain more recovery points by protecting snapshots on primary and secondary storage from deletion by ransomware attackers or rogue administrators
* xref:../anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous ransomware protection (ARP) enhancements]
+
Immediately enable intelligent autonomous ransomware protection on secondary storage, based on the screening model already completed for the primary storage. 
+
After a failover, instantly identify potential ransomware attacks on secondary storage. A Snapshot is immediately taken of the data that is starting to be affected, and administrators are notified, helping to stop an attack and enhance recovery. 
* xref:../nas-audit/plan-fpolicy-event-config-concept.html[FPolicy]
+
One-click activation of ONTAP FPolicy to enable automatic blocking of known malicious files The simplified activation helps to protect against typical ransomware attacks that use common, known file extensions.
* xref:../system-admin/ontap-implements-audit-logging-concept.html[Security hardening: Tamperproof retention logging]
+
Tamperproof retention logging in ONTAP insuring compromised administrator accounts cannot hide malicious actions. Admin and user history cannot be altered or deleted without the systems knowledge. 
+
Log and audit all admin actions regardless of origin guaranteeing all actions impacting data are captured. An alert is generated whenever system audit logs have been tampered with in any way notifying administrators of the change.
* xref:../authentication/setup-ssh-multifactor-authentication-task.html[Security hardening: Expanded multifactor authentication]
+
Multifactor authentication (MFA) for CLI (SSH) supports Yubikey physical hardware token devices ensuring that an attacker cannot access the ONTAP system using stolen credentials or a compromised client system. Cisco DUO is now supported for MFA with System Manager.
* File-object duality (multi-protocol access)
+
File-object duality enables native S3 protocol read and write access to the same data source that already has NAS protocol access. You can concurrently access your storage as files or as objects from the same data source, eliminating the need for duplicate copies of data for use with different protocols (S3 or NAS), such as for analytics that use object data.
* xref:../flexgroup/manage-flexgroup-rebalance-task.html[FlexGroup rebalancing]
+
In the event FlexGroup constituents become unbalanced, FlexGroup can now nondisruptively be rebalanced and managed from
CLI, REST API, and System Manager. For optimal performance, constituent members within a FlexGroup should have their used capacity evenly distributed.
* Storage capacity enhancements
+
WAFL Space Reservation has been significantly reduced, providing up to 400 TiB more usable capacity per aggregate.
| ONTAP 9.11.1
a|
* xref:../multi-admin-verify/index.html[Multiadmin verification]
+ 
Prevent malicious and accidental changes to your data by making sure that a single cluster administrator, or a ransomware
attacker with a compromised administrator account, cannot execute sensitive commands without approvals from one or more additional administrators.
* xref:../anti-ransomware/index.html[Enhancements to Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP)]
+ 
ARP uses machine learning to detect subtler ransomware attacks by automatically creating alerts and Snapshot copies when abnormal file activity occurs so you can quickly identify threats and accelerate recovery in the event of a data breach.
* xref:../flexgroup/supported-unsupported-config-concept.html#features-supported-beginning-with-ontap-9-12-1[SnapLock compliance for FlexGroup volumes] 
+
Secure multi-petabyte datasets for workloads such as EDA and media & entertainment by protecting the data with WORM file locking so that the data can't be changed or deleted. 
* Asynchronous directory delete 
+
Easily delete large directories and eliminate performance/latency impact to the host I/O.
* xref:../s3-config/ontap-s3-supported-actions-reference.html[S3 management enhancements]
+
With added S3 API endpoints, you can simplify and expand the object data management capabilities of ONTAP S3 as well as recover more easily from an accidental deletion or overwrite.
* System Manager enhancements 
+
ONTAP 9.12.1 adds support for advanced capabilities such as xref:../disks-aggregates/manage-use-local-tiers-overview-task.html[managing and configuring aggregates], gaining visibility into system analytics, and visualizing hardware for FAS systems.
