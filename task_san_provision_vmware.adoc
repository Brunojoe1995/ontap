This procedure creates new LUNs on an existing storage VM which already has the FC or iSCSI protocol configured.

If you need to create a new storage VM and configure the FC or iSCSI protocol, see link:san-admin/configure-svm-fc-task.html[Configure an SVM for FC] or link:san-admin/configure-svm-iscsi-task.html[Configure an SVM for iSCSI].

NOTE: Asymmetric logical unit access (ALUA) is always enabled during LUN creation. You cannot change the ALUA setting.

When you have completed this procedure, you can manage VMware datastores with Virtual Storage Console (VSC) for VMware vSphere. Beginning with VSC 7.0, VSC is part of the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere/index.html[ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere virtual appliance^], which includes VSC, vStorage APIs for Storage Awareness (VASA) Provider, and Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) for VMware vSphere capabilities.

Be sure to check the https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/[NetApp Interoperability Matrix^] to confirm compatibility between your current ONTAP and VSC releases.

For more information, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/virtualization/vsphere_ontap_ontap_for_vsphere.html[TR-4597: VMware vSphere for ONTAP^] and the documentation for your VSC release.

Create LUNs to provide storage with System Manager for ONTAP 9.7 or later. 

LUNs appear as disks to the ESXi host.

To set up SAN protocol access for ESXi hosts to datastores using System Manager Classic (for ONTAP 9.7 and earlier releases), see the following topics:

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/fc-config-esxi/index.html[FC configuration for ESXi using VSC overview^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/iscsi-config-esxi/index.html[iSCSI configuration for ESXi using VSC overview^]

NOTE: Asymmetric logical unit access (ALUA) is always enabled during LUN creation. You cannot change the ALUA setting.

.Steps

. In System Manager, click *Storage > LUNs* and then click *Add*.

. Enter the required information to create the LUN.

. For FC, zone your FC switches by WWPN. Use one zone per initiator and include all target ports in each zone.

. Use Virtual Storage Console (VSC) for VMware vSphere, to discover and initialize the LUN.

. Verify that the ESXi hosts can write and read data on the LUN.
