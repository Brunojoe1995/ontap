Create LUNs to provide storage for an ESXi host using the FC or iSCSI SAN protocol with ONTAP System Manager (9.7 and later). LUNs appear as disks to the ESXi host.

This procedure creates new LUNs on an existing storage VM. Your FC or iSCSI protocol should already be set up.

When you have completed this procedure, you can manage VMware datastores with Virtual Storage Console (VSC) for VMware vSphere. Beginning with VSC 7.0, VSC is part of the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere/index.html[ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere virtual appliance^], which includes VSC, vStorage APIs for Storage Awareness (VASA) Provider, and Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) for VMware vSphere capabilities.

Be sure to check the https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/[NetApp Interoperability Matrix^] to confirm compatibility between your current ONTAP and VSC releases.

To set up SAN protocol access for ESXi hosts to datastores using System Manager Classic (for ONTAP 9.7 and earlier releases), see the following topics:
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/fc-config-esxi/index.html[FC configuration for ESXi using VSC overview^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/iscsi-config-esxi/index.html[iSCSI configuration for ESXi using VSC overview^]

For more information, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/virtualization/vsphere_ontap_ontap_for_vsphere.html[TR-4597: VMware vSphere for ONTAP^] and the documentation for your VSC release.

.Steps

. In System Manager, click *Storage > LUNs* and then click *Add*.

.. Enter the required information to create the LUN.

. For FC, zone your FC switches by WWPN. Use one zone per initiator and include all target ports in each zone.

. Use Virtual Storage Console (VSC) for VMware vSphere, to discover and initialize the LUN.

. Verify that the ESXi hosts can write and read data on the LUN.
