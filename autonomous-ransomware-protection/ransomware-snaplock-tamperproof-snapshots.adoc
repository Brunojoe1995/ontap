A vital weapon in NetApp's Snap arsenal is SnapLock, which has proven highly effective in safeguarding against ransomware threats. By preventing unauthorized data deletion, SnapLock provides an additional layer of security, ensuring that critical data remains intact and accessible even in the face of malicious attacks.


== SnapLock
SnapLock Compliance provides indelible protection for your data. Once committed, SLC prohibits data from being deleted even when an administrator attempts to re-initialize the array. Unlike other competitive products, SnapLock Compliance is not vulnerable to social engineering hacks through those products' Support teams; you can be assured that data protected by SnapLock Compliance volumes are recoverable until that data has reached its expiration date.

To enable SnapLock, an ONTAP One license is required.

== Tamperproof Snapshot copies
Tamperproof Snapshot (TPS) copies provide a convenient and fast way to protect data from malicious acts. Unlike SnapLock Compliance, TPS is typically used on primary systems where the user can protect the data for a determined time and left locally for fast recoveries or where data does not need to be replicated off of the primary system. TPS uses SnapLock technologies to prevent the primary Snapshot copy from being deleted even by an ONTAP administrator using the same SnapLock retention expiration period, even if the volume is not SnapLock enabled, although they do not have the same indelible nature of SnapLock Compliance volumes.

To make Snapshot copies tamperproof, an ONTAP One license is required.
