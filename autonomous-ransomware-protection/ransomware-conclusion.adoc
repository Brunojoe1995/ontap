It is very clear that ransomware, like so many other malware threats, continues to evolve. Just as defensive methods improve, so do the attack methods and vectors. Although no single solution can thwart all attacks, using a portfolio of solutions, including partnerships and third parties, provides a layered defense.

The NetApp solution provides various effective tools for visibility, detection, and remediation, helping you to spot ransomware early, prevent this spread, and recover quickly, if necessary, to avoid costly downtime. Traditional layered defense solutions remain prevalent, as do third parties and partner solutions for visibility and detection. Effective remediation remains a crucial part of the response to any threat. The unique industry approach leveraging the immutable NetApp Snapshot technology and SnapLock logical air gap solution is an industry differentiator and the industry best practice for ransomware remediation capabilities.
