FPolicy blocks unwanted files from being stored on your enterprise-grade storage appliance. FPolicy also gives you a way to block known ransomware file extensions, too. The user still has full access permissions to their home folder, but FPolicy doesn’t allow them to store whatever files your administrator marks as blocked, whether it’s .mp3 files or known ransomware file extensions.

== Block malicious files with FPolicy native mode

NetApp FPolicy Native mode (an evolution of the name File Policy) is a file extension blocking framework that allows you to block unwanted file extensions from ever entering your environment. It has been part of ONTAP for over a decade, and it is incredibly useful in helping you protect against ransomware. This Zero Trust engine is valuable because you get extra security measures, beyond access control lists (ACLs) permissions.

FPolicy gives you a way to block known ransomware file extensions before they are written to your environment. Users still have full access permissions to their home folder, but FPolicy does not allow them to store any files that you mark as blocked.

In ONTAP System Manager and BlueXP, a list of over 3000 file extensions is available for reference.

[WARNING] 
Some of these extensions might be legitimate in your environment and blocking them can lead to unexpected issues. Create your own list that is appropriate for your environment before configuring Native FPolicy.

FPolicy native mode is included in all ONTAP licenses.

== Enable user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) with FPolicy external mode

FPolicy external mode is a file activity notification and control framework that provides visibility of file activities to user activity. These notifications can be used by an external solution to perform AI based analytics to detect malicious behavior.

Furthermore, FPolicy external mode can be configured to wait for approval from the FPolicy server before allowing specific activities to go through (see figure TBD). Multiple such policies can be configured on a cluster giving you great flexibility.

[WARNING]
FPolicy servers must be responsive to FPolicy requests if configured to provide approval, otherwise storage system performance might be negatively impacted.

FPolicy external mode is included in all ONTAP licenses.
