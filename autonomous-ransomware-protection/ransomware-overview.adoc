Ransomware remains one of the most significant threats causing business interruption for organization in 2024. According to the link:https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2024/04/30/the-state-of-ransomware-2024/[Sophos State of Ransomware 2024^], ransomware attacks affected 72% of their surveyed audience. Ransomware attacks have evolved to be more sophisticated and targeted, with threat actors employing advanced techniques like artificial intelligence to maximize their impact and profits. Organizations must look across their entire security posture from perimeter, network, identity, application and where the data lives at the storage level and secure these layers. Adopting a data-centric approach to cyber protection at the storage layer is crucial in today's threat landscape.

NOTE: Beginning in July 2024, content from the technical report _TR-4572: NetApp Ransomware Protection_, which was previously published as a PDF, has been integrated with the rest of the ONTAP product documentation. 

== Data is the primary target
Cybercriminals increasingly target data directly, recognizing its value. While perimeter, network, and application security are important, they can be bypassed. Focusing on protecting data at its source - the storage layer - provides a critical last line of defense. Gaining access to production data, encrypting and/or rendering it inaccessible, is the objective of ransomware attacks. To get there, attackers must have already pierced through existing defenses deployed by organizations today, from perimeter to application security.

Unfortunately, many organizations don't take advantage of security capabilities at the data layer. This is where NetApp ransomware protection portfolio comes in, protecting you at the last line of defense.

== The real cost of ransomware
You might think that the ransom payment itself is the largest monetary effect on a business. However, although the payment is not insignificant, it pales in comparison to the real cost of suffering a ransomware incident: downtime.

Ransom payments are just one element of recovery costs when dealing with ransomware events. Excluding any ransoms paid, in 2024, organizations reported a mean cost to recover from a ransomware attack of $2.73M, an increase of almost $1M from the $1.82M reported in 2023 according to the link:https://assets.sophos.com/X24WTUEQ/at/9brgj5n44hqvgsp5f5bqcps/sophos-state-of-ransomware-2024-wp.pdf[2024 Sophos State of Ransomware^] report. For organizations that rely heavily on IT availability (such as e-commerce, equities trading, and health care) costs can be 10 times higher or more.

Cyber insurance costs also continue to rise given the very real likelihood of a ransomware attack on insured companies.

== Ransomware protection at the data layer

We understand your security posture is wide and deep across your organization from the perimeter to the where your data lives at the storage layer. Your security stack is complex and should provide security at every level of your technology stack.

Protection at the data layer is even more important and has unique requirements. To be effective, solutions at this layer must offer three critical attributes:

. *Secure by design* to minimize chance of successful attack
. *Real-time detection and response* to minimize impact of a successful attack
. *Air-gapped WORM protection* to isolate critical data backups
. *Simple control plane* for comprehensive ransomware defense

NetApp can deliver all of this and more.
