Ransomware remains one of the most significant threats causing business interruption for organization in 2024. According to the link:https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2024/04/30/the-state-of-ransomware-2024/[Sophos State of Ransomware 2024^], ransomware attacks affected 72% of their surveyed audience. Ransomware attacks have evolved to be more sophisticated and targeted, with threat actors employing advanced techniques like artificial intelligence to maximize their impact and profits. Organizations must look across their entire security posture from perimeter, network, identity, application and where the data lives at the storage level and secure these layers. Adopting a data-centric approach to cyber protection at the storage layer is crucial in today's threat landscape.

NOTE: Beginning in July 2024, content from the technical report _TR-4572: NetApp Ransomware Protection_, which was previously published as a PDF, has been integrated with the rest of the ONTAP product documentation. 

== Data is the primary target
Cybercriminals increasingly target data directly, recognizing its value. While perimeter, network, and application security are important, they can be bypassed. Focusing on protecting data at its source - the storage layer - provides a critical last line of defense. Gaining access to production data, encrypting and/or rendering it inaccessible, is the objective of ransomware attacks. To get there, attackers must have already pierced through existing defenses deployed by organizations today, from perimeter to application security.

Unfortunately, many organizations don't take advantage of security capabilities at the data layer. This is where NetApp ransomware protection portfolio comes in, protecting you at the last line of defense.

== The real cost of ransomware
You might think that the ransom payment itself is the largest monetary effect on a business. However, although the payment is not insignificant, it pales in comparison to the real cost of suffering a ransomware incident: downtime.

Ransom payments are just one element of recovery costs when dealing with ransomware events. Excluding any ransoms paid, in 2024, organizations reported a mean cost to recover from a ransomware attack of $2.73M, an increase of almost $1M from the $1.82M reported in 2023 according to the link:https://assets.sophos.com/X24WTUEQ/at/9brgj5n44hqvgsp5f5bqcps/sophos-state-of-ransomware-2024-wp.pdf[2024 Sophos State of Ransomware^] report. For organizations that rely heavily on IT availability (such as e-commerce, equities trading, and health care) costs can be 10 times higher or more.

Cyber insurance costs also continue to rise given the very real likelihood of a ransomware attack on insured companies.

== Ransomware protection at the data layer

We understand your security posture is wide and deep across your organization from the perimeter to the where your data lives at the storage layer. Your security stack is complex and should provide security at every level of your technology stack.

Protection at the data layer is even more important and has unique requirements. To be effective, solutions at this layer must offer three critical attributes:

. *Secure by design* to minimize chance of successful attack
. *Real-time detection and response* to minimize impact of a successful attack
. *Air-gapped WORM protection* to isolate critical data backups
. *Simple control plane* for comprehensive ransomware defense

NetApp can deliver all of this and more.

== NetApp's ransomware protection portfolio

NetApp's built-in ransomware protection delivers a robust, multi-faceted defense for your critical data. At its core, advanced AI-powered detection algorithms continuously monitor data patterns, swiftly identifying potential ransomware threats with 99% accuracy. Reacting quickly to attacks allows our storage to quickly snapshot data and secure the copies ensuring rapid recovery.

To further fortify data, NetApp's cyber vaulting capability isolates data with a logical air gap. By safeguarding critical data, we ensure rapid business continuity.

NetApp BlueXP ransomware protection reduces operational burdens with a single control plane to intelligently coordinate and execute an end-to-end workload-centric ransomware defense, so you can identify and protect critical workload data at risk with a single click, accurately and automatically detect and respond to limit the impact of a potential attack, and recover workloads within minutes, not days, safeguarding your valuable workload data and minimizing costly disruption.

NetApp's ransomware protection offers peace of mind in an ever-evolving threat landscape. Its comprehensive approach not only defends against current ransomware variants but also adapts to emerging threats, providing long-term security for your data infrastructure.

== Ransomware recovery guarantee

NetApp offers a guarantee to restore Snapshot data if a ransomware attack occurs. Our guarantee: If we can't help you restore your Snapshot data, we'll make it right. The guarantee is available on new purchases of AFF A-Series, AFF C-Series, ASA, and FAS systems.

To learn more about the ransomware guarantee, read the link:https://www.netapp.com/how-to-buy/sales-terms-and-conditions/additional-terms/ransomware-recovery-guarantee/[service description^] and this link:https://www.netapp.com/blog/ransomware-recovery-guarantee/[blog^].

== Conclusion

It is very clear that ransomware, like so many other malware threats, continues to evolve. Just as defensive methods improve, so do the attack methods and vectors. Although no single solution can thwart all attacks, using a portfolio of solutions, including partnerships and third parties, provides a layered defense.

The NetApp solution provides various effective tools for visibility, detection, and remediation, helping you to spot ransomware early, prevent this spread, and recover quickly, if necessary, to avoid costly downtime. Traditional layered defense solutions remain prevalent, as do third parties and partner solutions for visibility and detection. Effective remediation remains a crucial part of the response to any threat. The unique industry approach leveraging the immutable NetApp Snapshot technology and SnapLock logical air gap solution is an industry differentiator and the industry best practice for ransomware remediation capabilities.
