[.lead]
Multifactor authentication (MFA) allows you to enhance security by requiring users to provide two authentication methods to log in to an admin or data SVM. 

* Depending upon your version of ONTAP, you can use a combination of an SSH public key, user password, and time-based one-time password (TOTP) to set up multifactor authentication.
