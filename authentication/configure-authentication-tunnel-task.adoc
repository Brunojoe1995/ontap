If you have already configured a SMB server for a data SVM, you can use the `security login domain-tunnel create` command to configure the SVM as a gateway, or _tunnel_, for AD access to the cluster.

.What you'll need

* You must have configured a SMB server for a data SVM.
* You must have enabled an AD domain user account to access the admin SVM for the cluster.
* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, if you have an SVM gateway (domain tunnel) for AD access, you can use Kerberos for admin authentication if you have disabled NTLM in your AD domain. In earlier releases, Kerberos was not supported with admin authentication for SVM gateways. This functionality is available by default; no configuration is required.

.NOTE
Kerberos authentication is always attempted first. In case of failure, NTLM authentication is then attempted.

.Step

. Configure a SMB-enabled data SVM as an authentication tunnel for AD domain controller access to the cluster:
+
`security login domain-tunnel create -vserver SVM_name`
+
For complete command syntax, see the link:config-worksheets-reference.html[worksheet].
+
[NOTE]
====
The SVM must be running for the user to be authenticated.
====
+
The following command configures the SMB-enabled data SVM``engData`` as an authentication tunnel.
