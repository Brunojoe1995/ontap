Beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1, administrators can configure and enable Dynamic Authorization to increase security of remote access to ONTAP. Dynamic Authorization provides a framework for assigning a security score to administrator users and challenging a user with additional authorization checks when their activity looks suspicious. Administrators can create rules, assign trust scores, and restrict commands to determine when certain activity is allowed or denied for a user. Administrators can enable Dynamic Authorization on a global basis or for individual storage VMs.
