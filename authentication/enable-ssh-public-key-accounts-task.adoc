You can use the `security login create` command to enable administrator accounts to access an admin or data SVM with an SSH public key.

.What you'll need

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.About this task

* You must associate the public key with the account before the account can access the SVM.
+
xref:manage-public-key-authentication-concept.adoc[Associating a public key with a user account]
+
You can perform this task before or after you enable account access.

* If you are unsure of the access control role that you want to assign to the login account, you can use the `security login modify` command to add the role later.

If you want to enable SSL FIPS mode on a cluster where administrator accounts authenticate with an SSH public key before accessing SVMs, you must ensure that the host key algorithm is supported before enabling FIPS.

*Note:* Host key algorithm support has changed in ONTAP 9.11.1 and later releases.

|===

Existing SSH public key accounts without the supported key algorithms must be reconfigured with a supported key type before enabling FIPS, or the administrator authentication will fail.

For more information, see link:../networking/configure_network_security_using_federal_information_processing_standards_@fips@.html[Configure network security using FIPS].

.Step

. Enable local administrator accounts to access an SVM using an SSH public key:
+
`security login create -vserver _SVM_name_ -user-or-group-name user_or_group_name -application _application_ -authmethod _authentication_method_ -role _role_ -comment _comment_`
+
For complete command syntax, see the link:config-worksheets-reference.html[worksheet].
+
The following command enables the SVM administrator account `svmadmin1` with the predefined `vsadmin-volume` role to access the SVM``engData1`` using an SSH public key:
+
----
cluster1::>security login create -vserver engData1 -user-or-group-name svmadmin1 -application ssh -authmethod publickey -role vsadmin-volume
----

.After you finish

If you have not associated a public key with the administrator account, you must do so before the account can access the SVM.
