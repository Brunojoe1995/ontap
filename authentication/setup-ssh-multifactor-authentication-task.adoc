Beginning with  ONTAP 9.3, you can use the `security login create` command to enhance security by requiring that administrators log in to an admin or data SVM with both an SSH public key and a user password.

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.About this task

* You must associate the public key with the account before the account can access the SVM.

+
You can perform this task before or after you enable account access.

* If you are unsure of the access control role that you want to assign to the login account, you can use the `security login modify` command to add the role later.

* The user is always authenticated with public key authentication followed by password authentication.

.Step

. Require local administrator accounts to access an SVM using SSH MFA:
+
`security login create -vserver _SVM_ -user-or-group-name _user_name_ -application ssh -authentication-method password|publickey -role admin -second-authentication-method password|publickey`
+
The following command requires the SVM administrator account `admin2` with the predefined `admin` role to log in to the SVM``engData1`` with both an SSH public key and a user password:
+
----
cluster-1::> security login create -vserver engData1 -user-or-group-name admin2 -application ssh -authentication-method publickey -role admin -second-authentication-method password

Please enter a password for user 'admin2':
Please enter it again:
Warning: To use public-key authentication, you must create a public key for user "admin2".
----

.After you finish

If you have not associated a public key with the administrator account, you must do so before the account can access the SVM.
