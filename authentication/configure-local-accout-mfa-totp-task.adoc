[.lead]
To take advantage of increased account security through multifactor authentication (MFA) with a time-based one-time password (TOTP), you must configure your local user account for TOTP use.

.Before you begin

* Your primary user account authentication method should be a user password or public SSH key
* The storage administrator must enable MFA with TOTP as a second authentication method for your user account.
* You must configure your TOTP app to work with your smartphone and create your TOTP secret key.
+
TOTP is supported by various authenticator apps such as Google Authenticator.

.Steps

. Log in to your user account with your current authentication method.
+
Your current authentication method should be a user password or a public SSH key.

. Create the TOTP configuration on your account:
+
security login totp create -vserver SVM_name -username account_username 

. Verify that the TOTP configuration is enabled on your account:
+
security login totp show -vserver SVM_name -username account_username
