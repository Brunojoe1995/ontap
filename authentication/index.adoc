[.lead]
You can enable login accounts for ONTAP cluster administrators and storage virtual machine (SVM) administrators. You can also use role-based access control (RBAC) to define the capabilities of administrators.

You enable login accounts and RBAC in the following ways:

* You want to use the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI), not System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You are not using SNMP to collect information about the cluster.
