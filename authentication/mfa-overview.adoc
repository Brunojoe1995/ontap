[.lead]
Multifactor authentication (MFA) allows you to enhance security by requiring users to provide two authentication methods to log in to an admin or data SVM. 

Depending upon your version of ONTAP, you can use a combination of an SSH public key, user password, Cisco Duo MFA, and time-based one-time password (TOTP) to set up multifactor authentication.

If MFA is configured with TOTP, the cluster administrator must first enable the local user account, then the account must be configured by the local user.
