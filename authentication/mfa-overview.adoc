[.lead]
Multifactor authentication (MFA) allows you to enhance security by requiring users to provide two authentication methods to log in to an admin or data SVM. 

Depending upon your version of ONTAP, you can use a combination of an SSH public key, user password, and time-based one-time password (TOTP) to set up multifactor authentication.
