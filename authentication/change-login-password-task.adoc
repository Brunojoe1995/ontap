[.lead]
You should change your initial password immediately after logging into the system for the first time. If you are an SVM administrator, you can use the `security login password` command to change your own password. If you are a cluster administrator, you can use the `security login password` command to change any administrator's password.

.About this task

The new password must observe the following rules:

* It cannot contain the user account name
* It must be at least six characters long (in ONTAP 9.13.1 and earlier) or eight characters long (beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1)
* It cannot be the same as the last six passwords
* It must contain at least one character from each of the following categories:
 ** English uppercase characters (A through Z)
 ** English lowercase characters (a through z)
 ** Base 10 digits (0 through 9)

Optionally, the password can contain one or more of the following special characters:
----
~ ! @ # $ % {caret} & * _ - + = ` \ | ( ) [ ] : ; " ' < > , . ? /
----

[NOTE]
You can use the `security login role config modify` command to modify the password rules for accounts associated with a given role. For more information, see the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-9131/security-login-role-config-modify.html[command reference^].

.Before you begin

* You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to change your own password.
