You should change your initial password immediately after logging into the system for the first time. If you are an SVM administrator, you can use the `security login password` command to change your own password. If you are a cluster administrator, you can use the `security login password` command to change any administrator's password.

.About this task

The new password must observe the following rules:

* It cannot contain the user name
* It must be at least eight characters long
* It cannot be the same as the last six passwords
* It must contain the following:
** At least one uppercase letter
** At least one lowercase letter
** At least one number

[NOTE]
You can use the `security login role config modify` command to modify the password rules for accounts associated with a given role. For more information, see the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-9131/security-login-role-config-modify.html[command reference^].
