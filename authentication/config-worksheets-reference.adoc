Before creating login accounts and setting up role-based access control (RBAC), you should gather information for each item in the configuration worksheets.

== Create or modify login accounts

You provide these values with the `security login create` command when you enable login accounts to access a storage virtual machine (SVM). You provide the same values with the `security login modify` command when you modify how an account accesses an SVM.

|===

h| Field h| Description h| Your value

a|
`-vserver`
a|
The name of the SVM that the account accesses. The default value is the name of the admin SVM for the cluster.
a|

a|
`-user-or-group-name`
a|
The user name or group name of the account. Specifying a group name enables access to each user in the group. You can associate a user name or group name with multiple applications.

a|

a|
`-application`
a|
The application that is used to access the SVM:

* `http`
* `ontapi`
* `snmp`
* `ssh`

a|

a|
`-authmethod`
a|
The method that is used to authenticate the account:

* `cert` for SSL certificate authentication
* `domain` for Active Directory authentication
* `nsswitch` for LDAP or NIS authentication
* `password` for user password authentication
* `publickey` for public key authentication
* `community` for SNMP community strings
* `usm` for SNMP user security model
* `saml` for Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication

a|

a|
`-remote-switch-ipaddress`
a|
The IP address of the remote switch. The remote switch can be a cluster switch monitored by the cluster switch health monitor (CSHM) or a Fibre Channel (FC) switch monitored by the MetroCluster health monitor (MCC-HM). This option is applicable only when the application is `snmp` and the authentication method is `usm`.
a|

a|
`-role`
a|
The access control role that is assigned to the account:

* For the cluster (the admin SVM), the default value is `admin`.
* For a data SVM, the default value is `vsadmin`.

a|

a|
`-comment`
a|
(Optional) Descriptive text for the account. You should enclose the text in double quotation marks (").
a|

a|
`-is-ns-switch-group`
a|
Whether the account is an LDAP group account or NIS group account (`yes` or `no`).
a|

a|
`-second-authentication-method`
a|
Second authentication method in case of multifactor authentication in *ONTAP 9.3*:

* `none` if not using multifactor authentication, default value
* `publickey` for public key authentication when the `authmethod` is password or nsswitch
* `password` for user password authentication when the `authmethod` is public key
* `nsswitch` for user password authentication when the authmethod is publickey
+
[NOTE]
====
Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, support for nsswitch is available.
====

The order of authentication is always the public key followed by the password.
a|

a|
`-is-ldap-fastbind`
a|
Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, when set to true, enables LDAP fast bind for nsswitch authentication; the default is false. To use LDAP fast bind, the `-authentication-method` value must be set to `nsswitch`. link:../nfs-admin/ldap-fast-bind-nsswitch-authentication-task.html[Learn about LDAP fastbind for nsswitch authentication.]

[cols="3*"]
|===

a|

a|
`-access`
a|
(Optional) The access level for the role. For command directories:

* `none` (the default value for custom roles) denies access to commands in the command directory
* `readonly` grants access to the `show` commands in the command directory and its subdirectories
* `all` grants access to all of the commands in the command directory and its subdirectories

For _nonintrinsic commands_ (commands that do not end in `create`, `modify`, `delete`, or `show`):

* `none` (the default value for custom roles) denies access to the command
* `readonly` is not applicable
* `all` grants access to the command

To grant or deny access to intrinsic commands, you must specify the command directory.

a|

a|
`-query`
a|
(Optional) The query object that is used to filter the access level, which is specified in the form of a valid option for the command or for a command in the command directory. You should enclose the query object in double quotation marks ("). For example, if the command directory is `volume`, the query object `"-aggr aggr0"` would enable access for the `aggr0` aggregate only.
