[.lead]
You can use the `security login create` command to enable Active Directory (AD) user or group accounts to access an admin or data SVM. Any user in the AD group can access the SVM with the role that is assigned to the group.

.What you'll need

* The cluster time must be synchronized to within five minutes of the time on the AD domain controller.
* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.About this task

* You must configure AD domain controller access to the cluster or SVM before the account can access the SVM.
+
xref:enable-ad-users-groups-access-cluster-svm-task.adoc[Configuring Active Directory domain controller access]
+
You can perform this task before or after you enable account access.

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can use link:../nfs-admin/ldap-fast-bind-nsswitch-authentication-task.html[LDAP fast bind for nsswitch authentication] if it is supported by the LDAP server.

* If you are unsure of the access control role that you want to assign to the login account, you can use the `security login modify` command to add the role later.

[NOTE]
====
AD group account access is supported only with the `SSH` and `ontapi` applications.
====

.Step

. Enable AD user or group administrator accounts to access an SVM:
+
`security login create -vserver SVM_name -user-or-group-name user_or_group_name -application application -authmethod domain -role role -comment comment [-is-ldap-fastbind true]`
+
For complete command syntax, see the link:config-worksheets-reference.html[worksheet].
+
link:config-worksheets-reference.html[Creating or modifying login accounts]
+
The following command enables the AD cluster administrator account `DOMAIN1\guest1` with the predefined `backup` role to access the admin SVM``engCluster``.
+
----
cluster1::>security login create -vserver engCluster -user-or-group-name DOMAIN1\guest1 -application ssh -authmethod domain -role backup
----
+
The following command enables the SVM administrator accounts in the AD group account `DOMAIN1\adgroup` with the predefined `vsadmin-volume` role to access the SVM``engData``.
+
----
cluster1::>security login create -vserver engData -user-or-group-name DOMAIN1\adgroup -application ssh -authmethod domain -role vsadmin-volume
----

.After you finish

If you have not configured AD domain controller access to the cluster or SVM, you must do so before the account can access the SVM.
