TLS enables encrypted network communications with equivalent security to and less complexity than Kerberos. As an administrator, you can enable, configure, and disable TLS for strong security with NFSv3 and NFSv4.x connections using System Manager, the ONTAP CLI, or the ONTAP REST API.

NFS over TLS requires certificates. You can either create an install a CA-signed server certificate on the ONTAP cluster, or you can install a certificate that the NFS service uses directly. Your certificates should meet the following guidelines:

* Each certificate must be configured with the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the NFS server (the data LIF on which TLS will be enabled/configured) as a common name (CN).
* Each certificate must be configured with the IP address of the NFS server as the Subject Alternative Name (SAN).
* You can install multiple NFS service certificates for the same LIF, but only one of them can be in use at a time as part of the NFS TLS configuration.
