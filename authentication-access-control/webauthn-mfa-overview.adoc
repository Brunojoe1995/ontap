Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, you can enable WebAuthn MFA for ONTAP users. This enables the users to log in to System Manager using a FIDO2 key (such as a YubiKey) as a second form of authentication. By default, WebAuthn MFA is disabled for existing and new ONTAP users. 

WebAuthn MFA is supported for users and groups that use the following types of first authentication method:
* password, domain, or nsswitch for users
* domain or nsswitch for groups

If an ONTAP administrator has enabled WebAuthn MFA as an authentication method for a user, the user is asked to register their hardware FIDO2 device upon logging in to System Manager. After registration, the passkey is stored in ONTAP.

NOTE: Users that have WebAuthn MFA configured as a second authentication method need to use the FQDN (for example https://myontap.example.com) instead of the IP address (for example https://192.168.100.200) to access System Manager. For these users, attempts to log in to the System Manager using the IP address are rejected.

//If you are using dynamic authorization, further authentication challenges can also use WebAuthn MFA for those users. (not supported for 9.16.1)
