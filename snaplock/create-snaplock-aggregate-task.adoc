You use the volume `-snaplock-type` option to specify a Compliance or Enterprise SnapLock volume type. For releases earlier than ONTAP 9.10.1, you must create a separate SnapLock aggregate. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, SnapLock and non-SnapLock volumes can exist on the same aggregate; therefore, you are no longer required to create a separate SnapLock aggregate if you are using ONTAP 9.10.1.

.What you'll need

* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.
* The SnapLock license must be installed on the node.
* The ComplianceClock on the node must be initialized.
* If you have partitioned the disks as "`root`", "`data1`", and "`data2`", you must ensure that spare disks are available.

.Upgrade considerations

When upgrading to ONTAP 9.10.1, existing SnapLock and non-SnapLock aggregates are upgraded to support the existence of both SnapLock and non-SnapLock volumes; however, the existing SnapLock volume attributes are not automatically updated. For example, data-compaction, cross-volume-dedupe, and cross-volume-background-dedupe fields remain unchanged. New SnapLock volumes created on existing aggregates have the same default values as non-SnapLock volumes, and the default values for new volumes and aggregates are platform dependent.

.Revert considerations

If you need to revert to an ONTAP version earlier than 9.10.1, you must move all SnapLock Compliance, SnapLock Enterprise, and SnapLock volumes to their own SnapLock aggregates.

.About this task

* You cannot create Compliance aggregates for FlexArray LUNs, but SnapLock Compliance aggregates are supported with FlexArray LUNs.
* You cannot create Compliance aggregates with the SyncMirror option.
* You can create mirrored Compliance aggregates in a MetroCluster configuration only if the aggregate is used to host SnapLock audit log volumes.

[NOTE]
====
In a MetroCluster configuration, SnapLock Enterprise is supported on mirrored and unmirrored aggregates. SnapLock Compliance is supported only on unmirrored aggregates.

.Steps

. Create a SnapLock aggregate:
+
`*storage aggregate create -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -node _node_name_ -diskcount _number_of_disks_ -snaplock-type compliance|enterprise*`
+
The man page for the command contains a complete list of options.
+
The following command creates a SnapLock `Compliance` aggregate named `aggr1` with three disks on `node1`:
+
----
cluster1::> storage aggregate create -aggregate aggr1 -node node1 -diskcount 3 -snaplock-type compliance
