[.lead]
You can use NetApp SnapLock technology to retain files in unmodified form for regulatory and governance purposes. It shows you how to commit files and Snapshot copies to "`write once, read many`" (WORM) storage, and how to set retention periods for WORM-protected data.

You should use these procedures if you want to work with SnapLock in the following ways:

* You want to use the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI), not System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
+
A limited but important set of SnapLock technology is available in System Manager. You can install SnapLock licenses, set the Compliance Clock, create SnapLock aggregates and volumes, and configure SnapLock volumes.

* You want to create Compliance or Enterprise aggregates to host SnapLock audit log volumes on MetroCluster configurations, with the following limitation:
+
** SnapLock Enterprise is supported on mirrored and unmirrored aggregates.
+
** SnapLock Compliance is supported on unmirrored aggregates only.
+
All MetroCluster configurations support mirrored aggregates. See the link:https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2492508[ONTAP release notes] to determine if your MetroCluster configuration supports unmirrored aggregates.

* You want to use SnapLock Enterprise aggregates with FabricPool.
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, SnapLock Enterprise aggregates are supported with link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/fabricpool/index.html[FabricPool].

* You are not using SAN LUNs
+
SAN LUNs are not supported on SnapLock volumes. Although it is possible to move SAN LUNs onto a SnapLock volume using legacy technology, this is not a supported operation, nor is any other operation involving SAN LUNs on a SnapLock volume.

* You are not using SMTape.
+
SMTape is not supported by SnapLock.

* You are not creating Compliance aggregates for array LUNs.
+
SnapLock Compliance aggregates do not support array LUNs.

* You are not creating Compliance aggregates with the SyncMirror option.
+
SnapLock Compliance aggregates do not support SyncMirror plexes.

[NOTE]
====
SSDs and Flash Pool aggregates are supported by SnapLock beginning with ONTAP 9.1.
