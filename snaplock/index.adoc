[.lead]
You can use NetApp SnapLock technology to retain files in unmodified form for regulatory and governance purposes. It shows you how to commit files and Snapshot copies to "`write once, read many`" (WORM) storage, and how to set retention periods for WORM-protected data.

You should use these procedures if you want to work with SnapLock in the following ways:

* You want to use the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI), not System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
+
A limited but important set of SnapLock technology is available in System Manager. You can install SnapLock licenses, set the Compliance Clock, create SnapLock aggregates and volumes, and configure SnapLock volumes.

* You want to create Compliance or Enterprise aggregates to host SnapLock audit log volumes on MetroCluster configurations, with the following limitation:
+
** SnapLock Enterprise is supported on mirrored and unmirrored aggregates.
+
** SnapLock Compliance is supported on unmirrored aggregates only.
+
All MetroCluster configurations support mirrored aggregates. See the link:https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2492508[ONTAP release notes] to determine if your MetroCluster configuration supports unmirrored aggregates.

* You want to use SnapLock Enterprise aggregates with FabricPool.
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, SnapLock Enterprise aggregates are supported with link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/fabricpool/index.html[FabricPool].

* You are not using SAN LUNs
+
SAN LUNs are not supported on SnapLock volumes. Although it is possible to move SAN LUNs onto a SnapLock volume using legacy technology, this is not a supported operation, nor is any other operation involving SAN LUNs on a SnapLock volume.

* You are not using SMTape.
+
SMTape is not supported by SnapLock.

* You are not creating Compliance aggregates for array LUNs.
+
SnapLock Compliance aggregates do not support array LUNs.

* You are not creating Compliance aggregates with the SyncMirror option.
+
SnapLock Compliance aggregates do not support SyncMirror plexes.

[NOTE]
====
SSDs and Flash Pool aggregates are supported by SnapLock beginning with ONTAP 9.1.

== What SnapLock is

SnapLock is a high-performance compliance solution for organizations that use WORM storage to retain files in unmodified form for regulatory and governance purposes. 

This feature helps to prevent deletion, change, or renaming of data to meet regulations such as SEC 17a-4, HIPAA, FINRA, CFTC, and GDPR. With SnapLock, you can create special-purpose volumes in which files can be stored and committed to a non-erasable, non-writable state either for a designated retention period or indefinitely. 

There are two SnapLock versions: SnapLock: Compliance and SnapLock Enterprise. Both versions run on NetApp systems with all storage types. This flexibility enables you to buy the type and amount of storage that fits your business needs for SnapLock WORM storage.

== Differences between Compliance and Enterprise modes

SnapLock Compliance and Enterprise modes differ mainly in the level at which each mode protects WORM files:

|===

h| SnapLock mode  h| Protection level h| WORM file deleting during retention

a|
Compliance  mode
a|
At the file level
a|
Cannot be deleted

a|
Enterprise mode
a|
At the disk level
a|
Can be deleted by the compliance administrator using an audited “privileged delete” procedure
|===

After the retention period has elapsed, you are responsible for deleting any files you no longer need. Once a file has been committed to WORM, whether under Compliance or Enterprise mode, it cannot be modified, even after the retention period has expired.

You cannot move a WORM file during or after the retention period. You can copy a WORM file, but the copy will not retain its WORM characteristics.

The following table shows the differences in capabilities supported by SnapLock Compliance and Enterprise modes:

MetroCluster configurations
a|
Yes, under the following conditions:

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, SnapLock Compliance is supported on unmirrored MetroCluster aggregates.
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, SnapLock Compliance is supported on mirrored aggregates, but only if the aggregate is used to host SnapLock audit log volumes.
* SVM-specific SnapLock configurations can be replicated to primary and secondary sites using MetroCluster.

a|
Yes, under the following conditions:

* Beginning with ONTAP 9, SnapLock Enterprise aggregates are supported.
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, SnapLock Enterprise aggregates with privileged delete are supported.
* SVM-specific SnapLock configurations can be replicated to both sites using MetroCluster.

a|
Support FabricPools on SnapLock aggregates
a|
No
a|
Yes, beginning with ONTAP 9.8. However, your account team needs to open a product variance request documenting that you understand that FabricPool data tiered to a public or private cloud is no longer protected by SnapLock because a cloud admin can delete that data.
[NOTE]
====
You should be aware that any data that FabricPool tiers to a public or private cloud is no longer protected by SnapLock because that data can be deleted by a cloud admin.

a|
FlexGroup volumes
a|
Yes, beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1; however, the following features are not supported:

* Legal-hold
* Event-based retention
* SnapLock for SnapVault (supported beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1)

You should also be aware of the following behaviors:

* The volume compliance clock (VCC) of a FlexGroup volume is determined by the VCC of the root constituent. All non-root constituents will have their VCC closely synced to the root VCC.
* SnapLock configuration properties are set only on the FlexGroup as a whole. Individual constituents cannot have different configuration properties, such as default retention time and autocommit period.

== MetroCluster configurations and compliance clocks

MetroCluster configurations use two compliance clock mechanisms, the Volume Compliance Clock (VCC) and the System Compliance Clock (SCC). The VCC and SCC are available to all SnapLock configurations. When you create a new volume on a node, its VCC is initialized with the current value of the SCC on that node. After the volume is created, the volume and file retention time is always tracked with the VCC.

When a volume is replicated to another site, its VCC is also replicated. When a volume switchover occurs, from Site A to Site B, for example, the VCC continues to be updated on Site B while the SCC on Site A halts when Site A goes offline.

When Site A is brought back online and the volume switchback is performed, the Site A SCC clock restarts while the VCC of the volume continues to be updated. Because the VCC is continuously updated, regardless of switchover and switchback operations, the file retention times do not depend on SCC clocks and do not stretch.

== Commit files to WORM

You can use an application to commit files to WORM over NFS or CIFS, or use the SnapLock autocommit feature to commit files to WORM automatically. You can use a _WORM appendable file_ to retain data that is written incrementally, like log information. For more information see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/snaplock/volume-append-mode-create-worm-appendable-files-task.html[Use volume append mode to create WORM appendable files].

== Data protection

SnapLock supports data protection methods that should satisfy most compliance requirements:

* You can use SnapLock for SnapVault to WORM-protect Snapshot copies on secondary storage.
* You can use SnapMirror to replicate WORM files to another geographic location for disaster recovery.

== Storage efficiency

Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, SnapLock supports storage efficiency features, such as data compaction, cross-volume-deduplication, and adaptive compression for SnapLock volumes and aggregates.

== 7-Mode Transition

You can migrate SnapLock volumes from 7-Mode to ONTAP by using the Copy-Based Transition (CBT) feature of the 7-Mode Transition Tool. The SnapLock mode of the destination volume, Compliance or Enterprise, must match the SnapLock mode of the source volume. You cannot use Copy-Free Transition (CFT) to migrate SnapLock volumes.

== Encryption

ONTAP offers both software- and hardware-based encryption technologies for ensuring that data at rest cannot be read if the storage medium is repurposed, returned, misplaced, or stolen.

*Disclaimer:* NetApp cannot guarantee that SnapLock-protected WORM files on self-encrypting drives or volumes will be retrievable if the authentication key is lost or if the number of failed authentication attempts exceeds the specified limit and results in the drive being permanently locked. You are responsible for ensuring against authentication failures.

[NOTE]
====
Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, encrypted volumes are supported on SnapLock aggregates.
