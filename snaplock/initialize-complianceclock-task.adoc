The SnapLock ComplianceClock ensures against tampering that might alter the retention period for WORM files. You must initialize the _system ComplianceClock_ on each node that hosts a SnapLock aggregate. Once you initialize the ComplianceClock on a node, you cannot initialize it again.

.What you'll need

* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.
* The SnapLock license must be installed on the node.

.About this task

The time on the system ComplianceClock is inherited by the _volume ComplianceClock_, which controls the retention period for WORM files on the volume. The volume ComplianceClock is initialized automatically when you create a new SnapLock volume.

[NOTE]
====
The initial setting of the ComplianceClock is based on the current system clock. For that reason, you should verify that the system time and time zone are correct before initializing the ComplianceClock. Once you initialize the ComplianceClock on a node, you cannot initialize it again.

.System Manager
--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can use System Manager to initialize the SnapLock Compliance Clock.

.Steps

. Navigate to *Cluster > Overview*.
. In the *Nodes* section, click *Initialize SnapLock Compliance Clock*.
. To display the Compliance Clock column and to verify that the Compliance Clock is initialized, in the *Cluster > Overview > Nodes* section, click *Show/Hide* and select *SnapLock Compliance Clock*.

.CLI
. Initialize the system ComplianceClock:
+
`*snaplock compliance-clock initialize -node _node_name_*`
+
The following command initializes the system ComplianceClock on `node1`:
+
----
cluster1::> snaplock compliance-clock initialize -node node1
----

. When prompted, confirm that the system clock is correct and that you want to initialize the ComplianceClock:
+
----
Warning: You are about to initialize the secure ComplianceClock of
the node "node1" to the current value of the node's system clock.
This procedure can be performed only once on a given node, so you
should ensure that the system time is set correctly before proceeding.

The current node's system clock is: Mon Apr 25 06:04:10 GMT 2016

Do you want to continue? (y|n): y
----

. Repeat this procedure for each node that hosts a SnapLock aggregate.
