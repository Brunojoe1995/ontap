You must have SnapLock security administrator privileges to perform a SnapLock volume move. This privilege is granted to you with the _snaplock_ role, introduced in ONTAP 9.8. If you have not already been assigned that role, you can ask your cluster administrator to create a SnapLock security user with this SnapLock security role.

.What you'll need

* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.
* You must have logged in on a secure connection (SSH, console, or ZAPI).

.About this task

The snaplock role is associated with the admin SVM, unlike the vsadmin-snaplock role, which is associated with the data SVM.

.Step

. Create an SVM administrator account with the SnapLock administrator role:
+
`*security login create -vserver _SVM_name_ -user-or-group-name _user_or_group_name_ -application _application_ -authmethod _authentication_method_ -role _role_ -comment _comment_*`
+
The following command enables the SVM administrator account `SnapLockAdmin` with the predefined `snaplock` role to access admin SVM `cluster1` using a password:
+
