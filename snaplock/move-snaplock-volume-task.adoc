You can use the `volume move` command to move a SnapLock volume to a destination aggregate.

.What you'll need

* You must have created a SnapLock-protected audit log before performing SnapLock volume move.
+
link:create-audit-log-task.html[Create an audit log].

* If you are using a version of ONTAP earlier than ONTAP 9.10.1, the destination aggregate must be the same SnapLock type as the SnapLock volume you want to move; either Compliance to Compliance or Enterprise to Enterprise. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, this restriction is removed and an aggregate can include both Compliance and Enterprise SnapLock volumes, as well as non-SnapLock volumes.
* You must be a user with the SnapLock security role.

.Steps

. Using a secure connection, log in to the ONTAP cluster management LIF:
+
`*ssh snaplock_user@node_mgmt_ip*`
. Move a SnapLock volume:
+
`*volume move start -vserver _SVM_name_ -volume _SnapLock_volume_name_ -destination-aggregate _destination_aggregate_name_*`
. Check the status of the volume move operation:
+
`*volume move show -volume _SnapLock_volume_name_ -vserver _SVM_name_ -fields volume,phase,vserver*`
