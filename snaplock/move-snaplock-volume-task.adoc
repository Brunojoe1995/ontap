You can use the `volume move` command to move a SnapLock volume to a destination aggregate.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can move a SnapLock volume to a destination aggregate of the same type, either Enterprise to Enterprise, or Compliance to Compliance. You must be assigned the SnapLock security role to move a SnapLock volume.

.What you'll need

* You must have created a SnapLock-protected audit log before performing SnapLock volume move.
+
link:create-audit-log-task.html[Create an audit log].

* The destination aggregate must be the same SnapLock type as the SnapLock volume you want to move; either Compliance to Compliance or Enterprise to Enterprise.
* You must be a user with the SnapLock security snaplock role.

.Steps

. Using a secure connection, log in to the ONTAP cluster management LIF:
+
`*ssh snaplock_user@node_mgmt_ip*`
. Move a SnapLock volume:
+
`*volume move start -vserver _SVM_name_ -volume _SnapLock_volume_name_ -destination-aggregate _destination_aggregate_name_*`
. Check the status of the volume move operation:
+
`*volume move show -volume _SnapLock_volume_name_ -vserver _SVM_name_ -fields volume,phase,vserver*`
