Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, you can use the SnapLock _volume append mode_ (VAM) feature to create WORM appendable files by default. A WORM appendable file retains data written incrementally, like log entries. Data is appended to the file in 256 KB chunks. As each chunk is written, the previous chunk becomes WORM-protected. You cannot delete the file until the retention period has elapsed.

.What you'll need

* The WORM appendable file must reside on a SnapLock volume.
* The SnapLock volume must be unmounted and empty of Snapshot copies and user-created files.

.About this task

Data does not have to be written sequentially to the active 256 KB chunk. When data is written to byte nÃ—256KB+1 of the file, the previous 256 KB segment becomes WORM-protected.

If you specify an autocommit period for the volume, WORM appendable files that are not modified for a period greater than the autocommit period are committed to WORM.

[NOTE]
====
VAM is not supported on SnapLock audit log volumes.
====

.Steps

. Enable VAM:
+
`*volume snaplock modify -vserver _SVM_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -is-volume-append-mode-enabled true|false*`
+
For a complete list of options, see the man page for the command.
+
The following command enables VAM on volume `vol1` of SVM``vs1``:
+
----
cluster1::>volume snaplock modify -vserver vs1 -volume vol1 -is-volume-append-mode-enabled true
----

. Use a suitable command or program to create files with write permissions.
+
The files are WORM-appendable by default.
