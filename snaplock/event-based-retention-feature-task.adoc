Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, you can define how long a file is retained after an event occurs by using the SnapLock _Event Based Retention (EBR)_ feature.

.What you'll need

* You must be a SnapLock administrator to perform this task.
+
link:create-compliance-administrator-account-task.html[Create a SnapLock administrator account]

* You must have logged in on a secure connection (SSH, console, or ZAPI).

.About this task

The _event retention policy_ defines the retention period for the file after the event occurs. The policy can be applied to a single file or all the files in a directory.

* If a file is not a WORM file, it will be committed to the WORM state for the retention period defined in the policy.
* If a file is a WORM file or a WORM appendable file, its retention period will be extended by the retention period defined in the policy.

You can use a Compliance-mode or Enterprise-mode volume.

[NOTE]
====
EBR policies cannot be applied to files under a Legal Hold.

*_Using EBR to extend the retention period of already existing WORM files_*

a|
EBR is convenient when you want to extend the retention period of already existing WORM files. For example, it might be your firm's policy to retain employee W-4 records in unmodified form for three years after the employee changes a withholding election. Another company policy might require that W-4 records be retained for five years after the employee is terminated.

In this situation, you could create an EBR policy with a five-year retention period. After the employee is terminated (the "`event`"), you would apply the EBR policy to the employee's W-4 record, causing its retention period to be extended. That will usually be easier than extending the retention period manually, particularly when a large number of files is involved.

.Steps

. Create an EBR policy:
+
`*snaplock event-retention policy create -vserver _SVM_name_ -name _policy_name_ -retention-period _retention_period_*`
+
The following command creates the EBR policy `employee_exit` on `vs1` with a retention period of ten years:
+
----
cluster1::>snaplock event-retention policy create -vserver vs1 -name employee_exit -retention-period 10years
----

. Apply an EBR policy:
+
`*snaplock event-retention apply -vserver _SVM_name_ -name _policy_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -path _path_name_*`
+
The following command applies the EBR policy `employee_exit` on `vs1` to all the files in the directory `d1`:
+
----
cluster1::>snaplock event-retention apply -vserver vs1 -name employee_exit -volume vol1 -path /d1
