Introduced in ONTAP 9.15.1, FlexCache writeback is an alternate mode of operation for writing at a cache. Writeback allows the write to be committed to stable storage at the cache and acknowledged to the client without waiting for the data to make it to the origin. The data is asynchronously flushed back to the origin. The result is a globally distributed file system that enables writes to perform at near-local speeds for specific workloads and environments, offering significant performance benefits.

NOTE: ONTAP 9.12.1 introduced a writeback feature as a public preview. This is referred to as writeback version 1 (wbv1) and shouldn't be thought of as the same as writeback in ONTAP 9.15.1, which is referred to as writeback version 2 (wbv2).

NOTE: Beginning in July 2024, content from technical reports previously published as PDFs has been integrated with ONTAP product documentation. The ONTAP security documentation now includes content from TR-4743: FlexCache in ONTAP 9.11.1.

== Writeback vs write-around

Since FlexCache was introduced in ONTAP 9.5, it has been a read-writable cache; however, it operated in write-around mode. Writes at the cache were shipped to the origin to be committed to stable storage. After the origin successfully committed the write to stable storage, it acknowledged the write to the cache. The cache would then acknowledge the write to the client. This made every write incur the penalty of traversing the network between the cache and origin. FlexCache writeback changes this.

NOTE: After upgrading to ONTAP 9.15.1, you can convert a traditional write-around cache to a writeback cache, and, if necessary, back to write-around. Do know that this can make reading diagnostic logs harder should a problem arise.
