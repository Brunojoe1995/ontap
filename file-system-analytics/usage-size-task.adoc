Tracking directories by size enables you to capture important data about the directories in a volume using the most space. Tracking directories by size is available beginning in ONTAP 9.12.1 and provides:

* The total number of directories in the volume
* The total number of files in the volume
* A bar chart identifying the largest directories in the volume by size in descending order

Tracking for large directories will refresh every 15 minutes. File System Analytics limits reporting of large directories to to the 25 directories consuming the most space.

You can monitor the most recent refresh by checking the *Last Refreshed* timestamp at the top of the page. You can additionally download tracking data to an Excel workbook with the **Download** button. The download operation will run in the background and present the most recently reported information for the selected volume. 

If the scan returns without any results, ensure the volume is online. Events such as SnapRestore will cause File System Analytics to rebuild its list of large directories. 

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Volumes*. Select the desired volume.
. From the individual volume menu, select *File System*. Then select the *Usage* tab. 
. Toggle the *Analytics* switch to enable usage analytics.  
. System Manager will display a bar graph identifying the directories with the largest size in descending order.

[NOTE]
ONTAP might display partial data or no data at all while the list of top directories is being collected. The progress of the scan can be in the *Usage* tab that displays during the scan.

Gain more insights about any directory by selecting the directory to go to the the Explorer tab. For more information about the *Explorer* tab, refer to xref:../task_nas_file_system_analytics_view.html[View activity on a file system].
