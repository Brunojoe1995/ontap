You should be aware of certain usage limits and potential performance impacts associated with implementing File System Analytics.

== SVM-protected relationships

If you have enabled File System Analytics on volumes whose containing SVM is in a protection relationship, the analytics data is not replicated to the destination SVM. If the source SVM must be resynchronized in a recovery operation, you must manually reenable analytics on desired volumes after recovery.

== Performance considerations

In some cases, enabling File System Analytics could negatively impact performance during the initial metadata collection. This is most typically seen on systems that are at maximum utilization. To avoid enabling analytics on such systems, you can use ONTAP System Manager performance monitoring tools.

If you experience a notable increase in latency, refer to the Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/ONTAP_OS/High_or_fluctuating_latency_after_turning_on_NetApp_ONTAP_File_System_Analytics[High or fluctuating latency after turning on NetApp ONTAP File System Analytics^].
