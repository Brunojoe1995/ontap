You should be aware of certain usage limits and potential performance impacts associated with implementing File System Analytics.


== SVM-protected relationships

If you have enabled File System Analytics on volumes whose containing SVM is in a protection relationship, the analytics data is not replicated to the destination SVM. If the source SVM must be resynchronized in a recovery operation, you must manually reenable analytics on desired volumes after recovery.

== Performance considerations

Enabling File System Analytics can incur a performance impact during the initial metadata collection. Do not enable analytics on the systems that are at a maximum utilization.

ONTAP System Manager provides xref:../concept_cluster_performance_overview.adoc[performance monitoring tools] to manage cluster health and metrics. 

If you experience a notable increase in latency, refer to the Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/ONTAP_OS/High_or_fluctuating_latency_after_turning_on_NetApp_ONTAP_File_System_Analytics[High or fluctuating latency after turning on NetApp ONTAP File System Analytics^].
