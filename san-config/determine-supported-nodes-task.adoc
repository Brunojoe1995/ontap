The number of nodes per cluster supported by ONTAP varies depending on your version of ONTAP, the storage controller models in your cluster, and the protocol of your cluster nodes.

.About this task

If any node in the cluster is configured for FC, FC-NVMe, FCoE, or iSCSI, that cluster is limited to the SAN node limits. Node limits based on the controllers in your cluster are listed in the _Hardware Universe_.

.Steps
