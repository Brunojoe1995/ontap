Zoning based on World Wide Name (WWN) specifies the WWN of the members to be included within the zone. When zoning in ONTAP, you must use World Wide Port Name (WWPN) zoning.

WWPN zoning provides flexibility because access is not determined by where the device is physically connected to the fabric. You can move a cable from one port to another without reconfiguring zones.

For Fibre Channel paths to storage controllers running ONTAP, be sure the FC switches are zoned using the WWPNs of the target logical interfaces (LIFs), not the WWPNs of the physical ports on the node. For more information on LIFs, see the _ONTAP Network Management Guide_.
