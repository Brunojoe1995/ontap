summary: "Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, the non-volatile memory express (NVMe) protocol is available for SAN environments. FC-NVMe allows you to run NVMe over an existing FC network with an AFF system. FC-NVMe uses the same physical setup and zoning practice as traditional FC networks but allows for greater bandwidth, increased IOPs and reduced latency than FC-SCSI."

Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/san-admin/manage-nvme-concept.html[non-volatile memory express (NVMe)] protocol is available for SAN environments. FC-NVMe uses the same physical setup and zoning practice as traditional FC networks but allows for greater bandwidth, increased IOPs and reduced latency than FC-SCSI.

Support for NVMe-oF protocol varies by platform and configuration. For details on your specific configuration, see the link:https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool].

You should be aware of the following when configuring FC-NVMe on your cluster.

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, 4-node MetroCluster IP configurations are supported on NVMe/FC.  
** MetroCluster configurations are not supported on NVMe/TCP.  
** MetroCluster configurations are not supported for NVMe prior to 9.12.1.
* You can set up your FC-NVMe configuration with single nodes or HA pairs using a single fabric or multifabric.
* FC-NVMe can be the only data protocol on data LIFs.
* You should configure one management LIF for every SVM supporting SAN.
* The use of heterogeneous FC switch fabrics is not supported, except in the case of embedded blade switches.
+
Specific exceptions are listed on the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^].

* Cascade, partial mesh, full mesh, core-edge, and director fabrics are all industry-standard methods of connecting FC switches to a fabric, and all are supported.
+
A fabric can consist of one or multiple switches, and the storage controllers can be connected to multiple switches.
