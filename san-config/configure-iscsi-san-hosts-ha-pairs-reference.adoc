You can configure the iSCSI SAN hosts to connect to dual-node or multi-node configurations by using either one or multiple IP switches. You should determine whether you want a single-switch configuration that is not completely redundant or a multi-switch configuration that is completely redundant.

You can configure iSCSI SAN hosts with single controllers and HA pairs on direct-attached, single-network, or multi-network environments. HA pairs can have multiple iSCSI connections to each switch, but multipathing software that supports ALUA is required on each host. If there are multiple hosts, you can configure each host with a different operating system by checking the NetAppInteroperability Matrix Tool.

== Direct-attachment

In a direct-attached configuration, one or more hosts are directly connected to the controllers.

== Single-network HA pairs

In single-network HA pair configurations, one switch connects the HA pair to one or more hosts. Because there is a single switch, this configuration is not fully redundant.

== Multi-network HA pairs

In multi-network HA pair configurations, two or more switches connect the HA pair to one or more hosts. Because there are multiple switches, this configuration is fully redundant.
