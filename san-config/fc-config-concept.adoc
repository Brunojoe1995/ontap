[.lead]
You should be aware of several things when setting up your FC configuration.

* You should set up your FC configuration with HA pairs using multifabric.
* You should configure two FC data LIFs per node.
+
This creates redundancy and protects against loss of data access.

* You should configure one management LIF for every storage virtual machine (SVM) supporting SAN.
* Multiple hosts, using different operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, or UNIX, can access the storage solution at the same time.
+
Hosts require that a supported multipathing solution be installed and configured. Supported operating systems and multipathing solutions can be verified on the Interoperability Matrix.

* ONTAP supports single, dual, or multiple node solutions that are connected to multiple physically independent storage fabrics; a minimum of two are recommended for SAN solutions.
+
This provides redundancy at the fabric and storage system layers. Redundancy is particularly important because these layers typically support many hosts.

* The use of heterogeneous FC switch fabrics is not supported, except in the case of embedded blade switches.
+
Specific exceptions are listed on the Interoperability Matrix.

* Cascade, partial mesh, full mesh, core-edge, and director fabrics are all industry-standard methods of connecting FC switches to a fabric, and all are supported.
+
A fabric can consist of one or multiple switches, and the storage controllers can be connected to multiple switches.
