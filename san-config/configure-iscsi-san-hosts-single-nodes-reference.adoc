= Ways to configure iSCSI SAN hosts with single nodes

[.lead]
You can configure the iSCSI SAN hosts to connect directly to a single node or by using either one or multiple IP switches. You should determine whether you want a single-switch configuration that is not completely redundant or a multi-switch configuration that is completely redundant.

You can configure iSCSI SAN hosts in a direct-attached, single-switch, or multi-switch environment. If there are multiple hosts connecting to the node, each host can be configured with a different operating system. For single and multi-network configurations, the node can have multiple iSCSI connections to the switch, but multipathing software that supports ALUA is required.

[NOTE]
====
If there are multiple paths from the host to the controller, then ALUA must be enabled on the host.

== Direct-attached single-node configurations

In direct-attached configurations, one or more hosts are directly connected to the node.

== Single-network single-node configurations

In single-network single-node configurations, one switch connects a single node to one or more hosts. Because there is a single switch, this configuration is not fully redundant.

== Multi-network single-node configurations

In multi-network single-node configurations, two or more switches connect a single node to one or more hosts. Because there are multiple switches, this configuration is fully redundant.
