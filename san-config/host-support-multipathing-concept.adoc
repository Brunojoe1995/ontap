ONTAP always uses Asymmetric Logical Unit Access (ALUA) for both FC and iSCSI paths. Be sure to use host configurations that support ALUA for FC and iSCSi protocols.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.5 multipath HA pair failover/giveback is supported for NVMe configurations using Asynchronous Namespace Access (ANA). In ONTAP 9.4, NVMe only supports one path from host to target. The application host needs to manage path failover to its high availability (HA) partner.

For information about which specific host configurations support ALUA or ANA, see the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sanhost/index.html[ONTAP SAN Host Configuration] for your host operating system.
