You can configure individual FC ports of onboard adapters and certain FC adapter cards for target mode. Target mode is used to connect the ports to FC initiators.

.About this task

Each onboard FC port can be individually configured as an initiator or a target. Ports on certain FC adapters can also be individually configured as either a target port or an initiator port, just like the onboard FC ports. A list of adapters that can be configured for target mode is available in the link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^].

The same steps are used when configuring FC adapters for the FC protocol and the FC-NVMe protocol. However, only certain FC adapters support FC-NVMe. See the link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] for a list of adapters that support the FC-NVMe protocol.

.Steps

. Take the adapter offline:
+
`node run -node _node_name_ storage disable adapter _adapter_name_`
+
If the adapter does not go offline, you can also remove the cable from the appropriate adapter port on the system.

. Change the adapter from initiator to target:
+
`system node hardware unified-connect modify -t target -node _node_name_`
. Reboot the node hosting the adapter you changed.
. Verify that the target port has the correct configuration:
+
`network fcp adapter show -node _node_name_`
. Bring your adapter online:
+
`network fcp adapter modify -node _node_name_ -adapter _adapter_port_ -state up`
