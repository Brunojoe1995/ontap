.Issue:

After performing a volume move operation on a consistency group volume, the volume move reference Snapshot copy might incorrectly display as the newest for the SnapMirror relationship.

You can view the newest Snapshot copy with the following command:

`snapmirror show -fields newest-snapshot status -expand`

.Solution:

Manually perform a `snapmirror resync` or wait for the next automatic resync operation after the volume move operation completes.
