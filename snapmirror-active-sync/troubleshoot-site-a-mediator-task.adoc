When using SM-BC, you may lose connectivity between the ONTAP Mediator or your peered clusters. You can diagnose the issue by checking the connection, availability, and consensus status of the different parts of the SM-BC relationship then forcefully resuming connection.

.Determining the cause

[cols=3,options="header"]
|===
| What to check | CLI command | Indicator
| Mediator from Site A | `snapmirror mediator show` | The connection status will be `unreachable` 
| Site B connectivity | `cluster peer show` | Availability will be `unavailable` 
| Consensus status of the SM-BC volume | `volume show _volume_name_ -fields smbc-consensus` | The `sm-bc consensus` field will read `Awaiting-consensus`
