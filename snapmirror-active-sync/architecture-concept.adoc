In section one of the diagram, an application is deployed on a SVM in the primary data center. The volumes that have been added to the primary consistency group are protected with SnapMirror active sync and are mirrored to secondary consistency group at a secondary data center. The volumes in the primary consistency group will failover to the mirrored consistency group in the event of a disruption. Volumes not in a mirrored consistency group are not served in the event of a failover. 

// key concepts 

SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) utilizes features such as consistency groups and the ONTAP Mediator to ensure your data is replicated and served even in the event of a disaster scenario. When planning your SM-BC deployment, it is important to understand the essential concepts in SM-BC and its architecture.

The diagram shows an enterprise application that is hosted on an storage VM (SVM) at the primary data center. The SVM contains five volumes, three of which are part of a consistency group. The three volumes in the consistency group are mirrored to a secondary data center. In normal circumstances, all write operations are performed to the primary data center; in effect, this data center serves as the source for I/O operations, while the secondary data center serves as a destination. 

In the event of a disaster scenario at the primary data center, the ONTAP Mediator will direct the secondary data center to act as the primary, serving all I/O operations. Only the volumes that are mirrored in the consistency group will be served. Any operations pertaining to the other two volumes on the SVM will be affected by the disaster event.
