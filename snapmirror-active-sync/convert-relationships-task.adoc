[.lead]
If you've configured symmetric SnapMirror protection, you can convert the relationship to SnapMirror active sync. Beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1, you can convert between types of SnapMirror active sync protection: from symmetric active/active to asymmetric and vice versa. 

== Convert to a symmetric active/active relationship

You can establish symmetric protection using System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

.Before you begin 

* Both clusters must be running ONTAP 9.15.1 or later. 
* Symmetric active/active configurations require the `AutomatedFailoverDuplex` protection policy. Alternately, you can xref:../data-protection/create-custom-replication-policy-concept.html[create a custom SnapMirror policy] provided the `-type` is `automated-failover-duplex`.

.Steps for a uniform configuration 
. Remove the destination igroup:
.. On the destination cluster, navigate to **Hosts** > **SAN Initiator Groups**. 
.. Select the igroup with the SnapMirror relationship, then **Delete**.
.. In the dialog box, select the **Unmap the associated LUNs** box then **Delete**. 
. Edit the SnapMirror active sync relationship.
.. Navigate to **Protection** > **Relationships**. 
.. Select the kabob menu next to the relationship you want to modify then **Edit**. 
.. Modify the **Protection Policy** to AutomatedFailoverDuplex. 
.. Selecting `AutoMatedFailoverDuplex` prompts a dialog box to modify host proximity settings. For the initiators, select the appropriate option for **Initiator proximal to** then **Save**.
.. Select **Save**.
. In the **Protection** menu, confirm the operation succeeded when the relationship displays as `InSync`.


.Steps for a non-uniform configuration 
. Remove the destination igroup:
.. On the secondary site, navigate to **Hosts** > **SAN Initiator Groups**. 
.. Select the igroup with the SnapMirror relationship, then **Delete**.
.. In the dialog box, select the **Unmap the associated LUNs** box then **Delete**. 
. Create a new igroup:
.. In the **SAN Initiator Groups** menu on the destination site, select **Add**.
.. Provide a **Name**, select the **Host Operating System**, then choose **Initiator Group Members**.
.. Select **Save**.
. Map the new igroup to the destination LUNs. 
.. Navigate to **Storage** > **LUNs**.
.. Select all the LUNs to map to the igroup.
.. Select **More** then **Map to Initiator Groups**. 
. Edit the SnapMirror active sync relationship.
.. Navigate to **Protection** > **Relationships**. 
.. Select the kabob menu next to the relationship you want to modify then **Edit**. 
.. Modify the **Protection Policy** to AutomatedFailoverDuplex. 
.. Selecting AutoMatedFailoverDuplex initiates the option to modify host proximity settings. For the initiators, select the appropriate option for **Initiator proximal to** then **Save**.
.. Select **Save**.
. In the **Protection** menu, confirm the operation succeeded when the relationship displays as `InSync`.

.Steps for a uniform configuration 
. Modify the SnapMirror policy from `AutomatedFailover` to `AutomatedFailoverDuplex`:
+
`snapmirror modify -destination-path _destination_path_ -policy AutomatedFailoverDuplex`
. Modifying the policy triggers a resync. Wait for the resync to complete and confirm the relationship is `Insync`:
+
`snapmirror show -destination-path _destination_path_`
. If the existing hosts are local to cluster-1, add the host to the second cluster and establish connectivity with respective access to each cluster depending on the configuration. 
. On the secondary site, delete the LUN maps on the igroups associated with remote hosts.
+
[NOTE]
Ensure the igroup does not contain maps for non-replicated LUNs.
+
`SiteB::> lun mapping delete -vserver _svm_name_ -igroup _igroup_ -path <>`
. On the primary site, modify the initiator configuration for existing hosts to set the proximal path for initiators on the local cluster.
+
`SiteA::> igroup initiator add-proximal-vserver -vserver _Svm_name_ -initiator _host_ -proximal-vserver _server_`
. Add a new igroup and initiator for the new hosts and set the host proximity for host affinity to its local site. Ennable igroup replication to replicate the configuration and inverse the host locality on the remote cluster. 
+
``
SiteA::> igroup modify -vserver vsA -igroup ig1 -replication-peer vsB
SiteA::> igroup initiator add-proximal-vserver -vserver vsA -initiator host2 -proximal-vserver vsB
``
. Discover the paths on the hosts and verify the hosts have an Active/Optimized path to the storage LUN from the preferred cluster
. Deploy the application and distribute the VM workloads across clusters.


.Steps for a non-uniform configuration
. Modify the SnapMirror policy from `AutomatedFailover` to `AutomatedFailoverDuplex`:
+
`snapmirror modify -destination-path _destination_path_ -policy AutomatedFailoverDuplex`
. Modifying the policy triggers a resync. Wait for the resync to complete and confirm the relationship is `Insync`:
+
`snapmirror show -destination-path _destination_path_`
. If the existing hosts are local to cluster-1, add the host to the second cluster and establish connectivity with respective access to each cluster depending on the configuration. 
. On the secondary site, delete the LUN maps on the igroups associated with remote hosts.
+
[NOTE]
Ensure the igroup does not contain maps for non-replicated LUNs.
+
`SiteB::> lun mapping delete -vserver _svm_name_ -igroup _igroup_ -path <>`
. On the primary site, modify the initiator configuration for existing hosts to set the proximal path for initiators on the local cluster.
+
`SiteA::> igroup initiator add-proximal-vserver -vserver _Svm_name_ -initiator _host_ -proximal-vserver _server_`
. On the secondary site, add a new igroup and initiator for the new hosts and set the host proximity for host affinity to its local site. Map the LUNs to the igroup. 
+
``
SiteB::> igroup create -vserver _svm_name_ -igroup _igroup_name_
SiteB::> igroup add -vserver _svm_name_ -igroup  _igroup_name_ -initiator _host_name_
SiteB::> lun mapping create -igroup  _igroup_name_ -path _path_name_
``
. Discover the paths on the hosts and verify the hosts have an Active/Optimized path to the storage LUN from the preferred cluster
. Deploy the application and distribute the VM workloads across clusters.

== Convert to an asymmetric relationship 

If you've configured symmetric active/active protection, you can convert the relationship to asymmetric protection.

.Steps
. Move all the VM workloads to the host local to the source cluster.
. Remove the igroup configuration for the hosts that are not managing the VM instances and modify the igroup configuration to terminate igroup replication.
+
`code`
. On the secondary site, unmap the LUNs. 
+
`SiteB::> lun mapping delete -vserver _svm_name_ -igroup _igroup_name_ -path <>`
. On the secondary site, delete the symmetric active/active relationship.
+
`SiteB::> snapmirror delete -destination-path _destination_path_`
. On the primary site, release the symmetric active/active relationship.
 `SiteA::> snapmirror release -destination-path _destination_path_ -relationship-info-only true`
. From the secondary site, create a relationship to the same set of volumes with the `AutomatedFailover` policy the resynchronize the relationship.
+
``
SiteB::> snapmirror create -source-path _source_path_ -destination-path _destination_path_ -cg-item-mappings _source:@destination_ -policy AutomatedFailover
SiteB::> snapmirror resync -destination-path vs1:/cg/cg1_dst
``
+
[NOTE]
The consistency group on the secondary site needs link:../consistency-groups/delete-task.html[to be deleted^] before recreating the relationship. The destination volumes link:https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/dp/SnapMirror/How_to_change_a_volume_type_from_RW_to_DP[must be converted to type DP^]. 
. Confirm the relationship Mirror State is `Snapmirrored` the Relationship Status is `Insync`.
+
`snapmirror show -destination-path _destination_path_`
. Re-discover the paths from the host.


== Convert an existing SnapMirror relationship to an asymmetric SnapMirror active sync relationship

If you have an existing Synchronous SnapMirror relationship between a source and destination cluster, you can convert it to an asymmetric SnapMirror active sync relationship. This allows you to associate the mirrored volumes with a consistency group, ensuring zero RPO across a multi-volume workload. Additionally, you can retain existing SnapMirror snapshots if you need to revert to a point in time prior to establishing the SnapMirror active sync relationship. 

.Before you begin

* A zero RPO Synchronous SnapMirror relationship must exist between the primary and secondary cluster.
* All LUNs on the destination volume must be unmapped before the zero RTO SnapMirror relationship can be created.
* SnapMirror active sync only supports SAN protocols (not NFS/CIFS). Ensure no constituent of the consistency group is mounted for NAS access.

.About this task

* You must be a cluster and SVM administrator on the primary and secondary clusters.
* You cannot convert zero RPO to zero RTO sync by changing the SnapMirror policy.
* You must ensure the LUNs are unmapped before issuing the `snapmirror create` command.
+
If existing LUNs on the secondary volume are mapped and the `AutomatedFailover` policy is configured, the `snapmirror create` will trigger an error. 

.Steps

. From the secondary cluster, perform a SnapMirror update on the existing relationship:
+
`destination::>snapmirror update -destination-path vs1_dst:vol1`

. Verify that the SnapMirror update completed successfully:
+
`destination::>snapmirror show`

. Quiesce each of the zero RPO synchronous relationships:
+
`destination::>snapmirror quiesce -destination-path vs1_dst:vol1`
+
`destination::>snapmirror quiesce -destination-path vs1_dst:vol2`

. Delete each of the zero RPO synchronous relationships:
+
`destination::>snapmirror delete -destination-path vs1_dst:vol1`
+
`destination::>snapmirror delete -destination-path vs1_dst:vol2`

. Release the source SnapMirror relationship but retain the common Snapshot copies:
+
`source::>snapmirror release -relationship-info-only true -destination-path vs1_dst:vol1`
+
`source::>snapmirror release -relationship-info-only true -destination-path vs1_dst:vol2`

. Create a group zero RTO Synchronous Snapmirror relationship:
+
`destination::> snapmirror create -source-path vs1_src:/cg/cg_src -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst -cg-item-mappings vol1:@vol1,vol2:@vol2 -policy AutomatedFailover`

. Resynchronize the consistency group:
+
`destination::> snapmirror resync -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`

. Rescan host LUN I/O paths to restore all paths to the LUNs.
