[.lead]
As a native, built-in ONTAP solution for protecting unauthorized access to your data, multi-admin verification (MAV) has a robust set of capabilities that ensure that operations such as deleting volumes, creating additional administrative users, or deleting snapshot copies can be executed only after approvals from at least a second designated administrator. This prevents compromised, malicious, or inexperienced administrators from making undesirable changes or deleting data.

You can configure as many designated administrator approvers as you want before a snapshot copy can be deleted.

MAV is included in link:../system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html[all ONTAP licenses].
