You can use the `cluster peer create` command to create a peer relationship between a local and remote cluster. After the peer relationship has been created, you can run `cluster peer create` on the remote cluster to authenticate it to the local cluster.

.Before you begin

* You must have created intercluster LIFs on every node in the clusters that are being peered.
* The clusters must be running ONTAP 9.3 or later. (If the clusters are running ONTAP 9.2 or earlier, refer to the procedures in link:https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2494079[this archived document^].)

.Steps

. On the destination cluster, create a peer relationship with the source cluster:
+
`cluster peer create -generate-passphrase -offer-expiration _MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS_|1...7days|1...168hours -peer-addrs _peer_LIF_IPs_ -initial-allowed-vserver-peers _svm_name_,..|* -ipspace _ipspace_`
+
If you specify both `-generate-passphrase` and `-peer-addrs`, only the cluster whose intercluster LIFs are specified in `-peer-addrs` can use the generated password.
+
You can ignore the `-ipspace` option if you are not using a custom IPspace. For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
If you are creating the peering relationship in ONTAP 9.6 or later and you do not want cross-cluster peering communications to be encrypted, you must use the `-encryption-protocol-proposed none` option to disable encryption.
+
The following example creates a cluster peer relationship with an unspecified remote cluster, and pre-authorizes peer relationships with SVMs `vs1` and `vs2` on the local cluster:
+
----
cluster02::> cluster peer create -generate-passphrase -offer-expiration 2days -initial-allowed-vserver-peers vs1,vs2

                     Passphrase: UCa+6lRVICXeL/gq1WrK7ShR
                Expiration Time: 6/7/2017 08:16:10 EST
  Initial Allowed Vserver Peers: vs1,vs2
            Intercluster LIF IP: 192.140.112.101
              Peer Cluster Name: Clus_7ShR (temporary generated)

Warning: make a note of the passphrase - it cannot be displayed again.

+
The following example creates a cluster peer relationship with the remote cluster at intercluster LIF IP addresses 192.140.112.103 and 192.140.112.104, and pre-authorizes a peer relationship with any SVM on the local cluster:
+
----
cluster02::> cluster peer create -generate-passphrase -peer-addrs 192.140.112.103,192.140.112.104 -offer-expiration 2days -initial-allowed-vserver-peers *

                     Passphrase: UCa+6lRVICXeL/gq1WrK7ShR
                Expiration Time: 6/7/2017 08:16:10 EST
  Initial Allowed Vserver Peers: vs1,vs2
            Intercluster LIF IP: 192.140.112.101,192.140.112.102
              Peer Cluster Name: Clus_7ShR (temporary generated)

. On source cluster, authenticate the source cluster to the destination cluster:
+
`cluster peer create -peer-addrs _peer_LIF_IPs_ -ipspace ipspace`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example authenticates the local cluster to the remote cluster at intercluster LIF IP addresses 192.140.112.101 and 192.140.112.102:
+
----
cluster01::> cluster peer create -peer-addrs 192.140.112.101,192.140.112.102

Notice: Use a generated passphrase or choose a passphrase of 8 or more characters.
        To ensure the authenticity of the peering relationship, use a phrase or sequence of characters that would be hard to guess.

Enter the passphrase:
Confirm the passphrase:

Clusters cluster02 and cluster01 are peered.
----
+
Enter the passphrase for the peer relationship when prompted.

. Verify that the cluster peer relationship was created:
+
`cluster peer show -instance`
+
----
cluster01::> cluster peer show -instance

                               Peer Cluster Name: cluster02
                   Remote Intercluster Addresses: 192.140.112.101, 192.140.112.102
              Availability of the Remote Cluster: Available
                             Remote Cluster Name: cluster2
                             Active IP Addresses: 192.140.112.101, 192.140.112.102
                           Cluster Serial Number: 1-80-123456
                  Address Family of Relationship: ipv4
            Authentication Status Administrative: no-authentication
               Authentication Status Operational: absent
                                Last Update Time: 02/05 21:05:41
                    IPspace for the Relationship: Default

. Check the connectivity and status of the nodes in the peer relationship:
+
`cluster peer health show`
+
----
cluster01::> cluster peer health show

             Ping-Status               RDB-Health Cluster-Health  Availâ€¦
