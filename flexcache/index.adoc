[.lead]
You can configure and manage FlexCache volumes for accelerating data access.

Use these procedures to configure FlexCache volumes if the following are true:

* You are running ONTAP 9.5 or later.
* You want to use the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI), not System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
+
Details about command syntax are available from the CLI help and the ONTAP man pages.

* You have cluster administrator privileges, not SVM administrator privileges.
