If you are running ONTAP 9.6 or earlier, you must install a FlexCache license, which is a capacity-based and term-based license, by using System Manager.

.About this task

The FlexCache license is a cluster-wide license. The license includes an entitled usage limit that you purchase for using FlexCache volumes in the cluster. The space usage by FlexCache volumes across the cluster must not exceed the capacity of the entitled usage limit. If you need to increase the usage limit of the license, you should contact your sales representative.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, FlexCache functionality is included with ONTAP and no longer requires a license or activation.Â 

.Steps

. Download the NetApp License File for the FlexCache license from the NetApp Support Site.

.. In the *Add License Packages* dialog box, click *Choose Files* to select the NetApp License File that you downloaded, and then click *Add* to upload the file to the cluster.
