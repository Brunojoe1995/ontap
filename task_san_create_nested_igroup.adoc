Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can create an igroup that consists of other existing igroups.

. In System Manager, click *Host > SAN Initiator Groups*, and then click *Add*.

. Enter the igroup *Name* and *Description*.
+
The description serves as the igroup alias.

. Select the *Storage VM* and *Host Operating System*.
+
NOTE: The OS type of a nested igroup cannot be changed after the igroup is created.

. Under *Initiator Group Members* select *Existing initiator group*.
+
You can use *Search* to find and select the initiator groups you want to add.
