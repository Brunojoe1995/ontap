When data in a volume is lost or corrupted, you can roll back your data by restoring from an earlier Snapshot copy.

This procedure replaces the current data on the source volume with data from an earlier Snapshot copy version. You should perform this task on the destination  cluster.

.Steps

. Click *Protection > Relationships*, and then click the source volume name.

. Click image:icon_kabob.gif[alt=Menu Options] and then select *Restore*.

. Under *Source*, the source volume is selected by default. Click *Other Volume* if you want to choose a volume other than the source.

. Under *Destination*, choose the Snapshot copy you want to restore.

. If your source and destination are located on different clusters, on the remote cluster, click *Protection > Relationships* to monitor the restore progress.
