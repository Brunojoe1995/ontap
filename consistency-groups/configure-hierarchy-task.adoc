If your application workload consists of more than one subset of volumes, where each subset is consistent across its own associated volumes, ONTAP enables you to create a hierarchical consistency group.

Hierarchical consistency groups have a parent that can include up to five individual consistency groups. Hierarchical consistency groups can support different local Snapshot policies across consistency groups or individual volumes. If you use a remote SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) policy, that will apply for the entire hierarchical consistency group (parent and children). 

For object limits on consistency groups, see xref:limits.html[Object limits for consistency groups].

.Create a hierarchical consistency group with new volumes
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select *+Add* then *Using New LUNs*.
. Name the consistency group. Designate the number of LUNs and capacity per LUN.
.. **Application Type**: If you are using ONTAP 9.12.1 or later, select an application type. If no value is selected, the consistency group will be assigned the type of **Other** by default. Learn more about tagging consistency in xref:index.html#application-and-component-tags[Application and component tags]. If you plan to create an SM-BC relationship, you must use *Other*.
. Select the host operating system and LUN format. Enter the host initiator information.
. To configure protection policies, add a child consistency group, or show more options about host initiators, select *More options*.
. To add a child consistency group, select *+Add child consistency group*.
. Select the performance level, the number of LUNs, and capacity per LUN. Designate the host operating system, LUN format, and select a new or existing host initiator group.
. *Optional*: select a local snapshot policy.
. Repeat for up to five child consistency groups.
. Select *Save*.
. Confirm your consistency group has been created by returning to the main consistency group menu where it will appear once the ONTAP job completes. If you set a protection policy, look under the appropriate policy, remote or local, which should display a green shield with a checkmark in it.

.Create a hierarchical consistency group with existing volumes
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select *+Add* then *Using existing volumes*.
. Select the storage VM.
. Select the existing volumes to include. Only volumes that are not already part of a consistency group will be available for selection.
. To add a child consistency group, select *+Add Child Consistency Group*. Create the necessary consistency groups, which will be named automatically.
.. **Component Type**: If you are using ONTAP 9.12.1 or later, select a component type of "data", "logs", or "other". If no value is selected, the consistency group will be assigned the type of **Other** by default. Learn more about tagging consistency in xref:index.html#application-and-component-tags[Application and component tags]. If you plan to create an SM-BC relationship, you must use *Other*.
. Assign existing volumes to each consistency group.
.. *Optional*: select a local Snapshot policy. 
. Repeat for up to five child consistency groups.
. Select *Save*.
. Confirm your consistency group has been created by returning to the main consistency group menu where it will appear once the ONTAP job completes. If you have chosen a protection policy, confirm it was properly set by selecting your consistency group from the menu; under the appropriate policy type, you will see a green shield with a checkmark inside of it.
