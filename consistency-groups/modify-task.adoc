[.lead]
Beginning in ONTAP 9.12.1, you can modify a consistency group in System Manager by removing volumes or adding existing volumes (expanding the consistency group).

== Add volumes to a consistency group

.Considerations
* You cannot add volumes associated with another consistency group.
* Consistency groups support NAS, SAN, and NVMe protocols. For more information about consistency groups, refer to the xref:index.html[Consistency groups overview].
* You can add up to 16 volumes at a time to a consistency group, provided that adjustments are within the overall xref:index.html#consistency-group-object-limits[consistency group limits].
* Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can add volumes to a consistency group configure with a SnapMirror Business Continuity relationship without an impact on RTO or RPO. 
+
In ONTAP 9.12.1, you _cannot_ add volumes to a consistency group in a SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) relationship. You must first break the SM-BC relationship, then modify the consistency group and then restore protection with SM-BC.
* The ONTAP REST API supports adding _new_ or existing volumes to a consistency group. For more information about the ONTAP REST API, refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-automation/reference/api_reference.html#access-a-copy-of-the-ontap-rest-api-reference-documentation[ONTAP REST API reference documentation^]. 
* When expanding a consistency group, Snapshot copies of the consistency group captured before the expand operation will be considered partial. Any restore operation based on that Snapshot copy will reflect the consistency group at the point-in-time of the snapshot.
* If you are using ONTAP 9.10.1 through 9.11.1, you cannot modify a consistency group. To change the configuration of a consistency group in ONTAP 9.10.1 or 9.11.1, you must delete the consistency group, then create a new consistency group with the volumes you want to include.

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the consistency group that you want to modify.
. If you are modifying a single consistency group, at the top of the *Volumes* menu, select *More* and then *Expand* to add a volume.
+
If you are modifying a child consistency group, identify the parent consistency group you want to modify. Select the *>* button to view the child consistency groups, then select image:../media/icon_kabob.gif[three vertically stacked dots] next to the name of the child consistency group you want to modify. From that menu, select *Expand*.
. Select up to 16 volumes to add to the consistency group.
. Select *Save*. When the operation completes, you can view the newly added volumes in the consistency group's *Volumes* menu. 

== Remove volumes from a consistency group

Volumes removed from a consistency group will no longer exist in the consistency group, but will not be deleted; they will still exist in the cluster. 

.Considerations
* You cannot remove volumes from a consistency group in a SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) relationship. You must first break the SM-BC relationship to modify the consistency group.
* If a consistency group has no volumes in it following the remove operation, the consistency group will be deleted.
* When a volume is removed from a consistency group, existing Snapshots of the consistency group remain but are invalid and cannot be used to restore the contents of the consistency group. Volume-granular Snapshots remain valid. 
* If you delete a volume from the cluster, it is automatically removed from the consistency group. 
* If you are using ONTAP 9.10.1 or 9.11.1, you can only remove volumes from a consistency group by deleting the volume from the cluster. To change the configuration of a consistency group in ONTAP 9.10.1 or 9.11.1, you must delete the consistency group then create a new consistency group with the desired member volumes. 

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the single or child consistency group that you want to modify. 
. In the *Volumes* menu, select the checkboxes next to the individual volumes you want to remove from the consistency group. 
. Select *Remove volumes from the consistency group*.
. Confirm that you understand removing the volumes will cause all Snapshot copies of the consistency group to become invalid and select *Remove*. 

== Move volumes between consistency groups

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can move volumes between child consistency groups that share a parent. 

.Considerations
* You can only move volumes between consistency groups that have a common parent consistency group. 
* Snapshot copies of the child consistency group that you are removing volumes from will be deleted. 
+
Snapshot copies of the consistency group hosting the moved volumes (that is, the destination you are moving volumes _to_) captured before the move operation will be considered partial. Any restore operation based on one of those Snapshot copies will reflect the consistency group at the point-in-time of the Snapshot copy. 
* Snapshot copies of the parent consistency group remain valid. 
* If you move all volumes out of a child consistency group, that child consistency group will be deleted. 
* Modifications to a consistency group must abide by xref:index.html#consistency-group-object-limits[consistency group limits].

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the parent consistency group that contains the volumes you want to move. Find the child consistency group and then expand the **Volumes** menu. Select the volumes you want to move.
. Select **Move**. 
. Choose whether you want to move the volumes to a new consistency group or an existing group. 
.. To move to an existing consistency group, select **Existing child consistency group** then choose the consistency group's name from the dropdown menu. 
.. To move to a new consistency group, select **New child consistency group**. Enter a name for the new child consistency group and select a component type. 
. Select **Move**.
