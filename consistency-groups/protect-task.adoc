Consistency groups offer easily managed local and remote protection for SAN, NAS, and NVMe applications that span multiple volumes.

Creating a consistency group does not automatically enable protection. Protection policies can be set at the time of creation or after creating your consistency group. You can protect consistency groups using:

* Local Snapshot policies
* SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC)
* xref:index.html#consistency-groups-in-MetroCluster-configurations[MetroCluster (beginning 9.11.1)]
* Asynchronous SnapMirror (beginning 9.13.1)
* Asynchronous SVM data replication (beginning 9.14.1)

If you are utilizing nested consistency groups, you can set different protection policies for the parent and child consistency groups.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, consistency groups offer <<two-phase,two-phase consistency group Snapshot creation>>. The two-phase Snapshot executes a precheck, ensuring the Snapshot will be captured successfully.  

Recovery can occur for an entire consistency group, a single consistency group in a hierarchical configuration, or for individual volumes within the consistency group. Recovery can be achieved by selecting the consistency group you want to recover from, selecting the Snapshot copy type, and then identifying the Snapshot copy to base the restoration on. For more information about this process, see link:../task_dp_restore_from_vault.html[Restore a volume from an earlier Snapshot copy].

== Set or modify a local Snapshot policy

Setting a local snapshot protection policy allows you to create a policy spanning all volumes in a consistency group.

== Create two-phase consistency group Snapshots [[two-phase]]

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, consistency groups support two-phase commits for consistency group (CG) Snapshot creation, which execute a precheck before committing the Snapshot. This feature is only available with the ONTAP REST API.

Two-phase CG Snapshot creation is only available for Snapshot creation, not provisioning consistency groups or restoring consistency groups. 

A two-phase CG Snapshot creation breaks the Snapshot creation process into two phases:

. In the first phase initiated with a POST request, the API executes prechecks and triggers Snapshot creation. When you issue the POST request, it includes a timeout parameter, designating the amount of time for the Snapshot to commit successfully. 
. If the POST request in phase one completes with a 201 status code, you can invoke the second phase within the designated interval from the first phase, committing the Snapshot to the appropriate endpoint.  

For more information about the ONTAP REST API, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-automation/reference/api_reference.html[API reference^] or the link:https://devnet.netapp.com/restapi.php[ONTAP REST API page^] at the NetApp Developer Network for a complete list of API endpoints. 

.Before you begin
* To use two-phase CG Snapshot creation, all nodes in the cluster must be running ONTAP 9.11.1 or later. 
* Only one active invocation of a consistency group Snapshot creation operation is supported on a consistency group instance at a time, whether it be a one-phase or two-phase. Attempting to invoke a Snapshot creation while another one is in progress will result in a failure. 
* When you invoke the Snapshot, you can set an optional timeout value of between 5 and 120 seconds. If not timeout value is provided, the operation will timeout at the default of 7 seconds. In the API, set the timeout value with the `action_timeout` parameter. In the CLI, use the `-timeout` flag.

.CLI
--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can create a two-phase Snapshot using the CLI. 

[NOTE]
If you implement the two-phase Snapshot using the ONTAP API, you must complete it using the API as the API does not return all of the necessary information to complete the Snapshot using the CLI. 

.Steps
. Initiate the Snapshot:
+
`consistency-group snapshot start -vserver _svm_name_ -consistency-group _consistency_group_name_ -snapshot _snapshot_name_ [-timeout _time_in_seconds_ -write-fence {true|false}]`
. Verify the Snapshot was taken:
+
`consistency-group snapshot show`
. Commit the Snapshot: 
+
`consistency-group snapshot commit _svm_name_ -consistency-group _consistency_group_name_ -snapshot _snapshot_name_`
--

.API
--
. Invoke the Snapshot creation. Send a POST request to the consistency group endpoint using the `action=start` parameter.
+
[source,curl]
----
curl -k -X POST 'https://<IP_address>/application/consistency-groups/<cg-uuid>/snapshots?action=start&action_timeout=7' -H "accept: application/hal+json" -H "content-type: application/json" -d '
{
  "name": "<snapshot_name>",
  "consistency_type": "crash",
  "comment": "<comment>",
  "snapmirror_label": "<SnapMirror_label>"
}'
----
+
. If the POST request succeeds, your output will include a snapshot uuid. Using that uuid, submit a PATCH request to commit the Snapshot.

== Set remote protection for a consistency group

Consistency groups offer remote protection through SM-BC and, Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, asynchronous SnapMirror.

=== Configure protection with SM-BC

You can utilize SM-BC to ensure Snapshot copies of consistency groups created on your consistency group are copied to the destination. To learn more about SM-BC or how to configure SM-BC using the CLI, see xref:../task_san_configure_protection_for_business_continuity.html[Configure protection for business continuity].

.Before you begin
* SM-BC relationships cannot be established on volumes mounted for NAS access.
* The policy labels in the source and destination cluster must match.
* SM-BC will not replicate Snapshot copies by default unless a rule with a SnapMirror label is added to the predefined `AutomatedFailOver` policy and the Snapshot copies are created with that label.
+
To learn more about this process, refer to link:../task_san_configure_protection_for_business_continuity.html[Protect with SM-BC].
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can non-disruptively xref:modify-task.html#add-volumes-to-a-consistency-group[add volumes to a consistency group] with an active SM-BC relationship. Any other changes to a consistency group require you to break the SM-BC relationship, modify the consistency group, then reestablish and resynchronize the relationship. 

.Steps for System Manager
. Ensure you have met the link:../smbc/smbc_plan_prerequisites.html[prerequisites for using SM-BC].
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the consistency group you have created from the Consistency group menu.
. At the top right of the overview page, select *More* then *Protect*.
. System Manager auto-fills source-side information. Select the appropriate cluster and storage VM for the destination. Select a protection policy. Ensure that *Initialize relationship* is checked.
. Select *Save*.
. The consistency group needs to initialize and synchronize. Confirm synchronization has completed successfully by returning to the *Consistency group* menu. The *SnapMirror (Remote)* status displays `Protected` next to image:../media/icon_shield.png[alt=green shield icon].

[NOTE]
To configure SM-BC with the CLI, see xref:../task_san_configure_protection_for_business_continuity.html[Protect with SM-BC].

=== Configure asynchronous SnapMirror protection

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can configure asynchronous SnapMirror protection for a single consistency group. 

.About this task 
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can use Asynchronous SnapMirror to replicate volume-granular Snapshots to the destination cluster if the volume-granular Snapshot matches the policy type of the consistency group Snapshot policy (e.g. MirrorAndVault, Vault, or MirrorAllSnapshots). Volume-granular Snapshots on the destination abide by the retention policy on the destination cluster independent of the consistency group Snapshots. For example, if you have a policy to retain two Snapshots on the destination, you can have two volume-granular Snapshots _and_ two consistency group Snapshots. 

When resynchronizing a consistency group, you can preserve volume-granular Snapshots with the `-preserve` flag. Volume-granular Snapshots newer than consistency group Snapshot are preserved. If there is not a consistency group Snapshot, no volume-granular Snapshots can be transferred in the resync operation. 

.Before you begin
* Asynchronous SnapMirror protection is only available for single consistency groups. It is not supported for hierarchical consistency groups. To convert a hierarchical consistency group into a single consistency group, see xref:modify-geometry-task.html[modify consistency group architecture].
* xref:../data-protection/supported-deployment-config-concept.html[Cascade deployments] are not supported with SM-BC. 
* The policy labels in the source and destination cluster must match.
* You can non-disruptively xref:modify-task.html#add-volumes-to-a-consistency-group[add volumes to a consistency group] with an active asynchronous SnapMirror relationship. Any other changes to a consistency group require you to break the SnapMirror relationship, modify the consistency group, then reestablish and resynchronize the relationship. 
* If you have configured an asynchronous SnapMirror protection relationship for multiple individual volumes, you can convert those volumes into a consistency group while retaining the existing Snapshots. To convert volumes successfully:
  * There must be a common Snapshot copy of the volumes.
  * You must break the existing SnapMirror relationship, xref:configure-task.html[add the volumes to a single consistency group], then resynchronize the relationship using the following workflow.  


.Steps
. From the destination cluster, select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the consistency group you have created from the Consistency group menu.
. At the top right of the overview page, select *More* then *Protect*.
. System Manager auto-fills source-side information. Select the appropriate cluster and storage VM for the destination. Select a protection policy. Ensure that *Initialize relationship* is checked.
+
When selecting an asynchronous policy, you have the option to **Override Transfer Schedule**. 
+
[NOTE]
The minimum supported schedule (recovery point objective, or RPO) for consistency groups with asynchronous SnapMirror is 30 minutes.

. Select *Save*.
. The consistency group needs to initialize and synchronize. Confirm synchronization has completed successfully by returning to the *Consistency group* menu. The *SnapMirror (Remote)* status displays `Protected` next to image:../media/icon_shield.png[alt=green shield icon].

== Visualize relationships

System Manager visualizes LUN maps under the *Protection > Relationships* menu. When you select a source relationship, System Manager displays a visualization of the source relationships. By selecting a volume, you can delve deeper into these relationships to see a list of the contained LUNs and the initiator group relationships. This information can be downloaded as an Excel workbook from the individual volume view; the download operation will run in the background.
