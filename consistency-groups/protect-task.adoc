Consistency groups offer easily managed local and remote protection for SAN, NAS, and NVMe applications that span multiple volumes.

Creating a consistency group does not automatically enable protection. Local and/or remote protection policies can be set at the time of creation or after creating your consistency group. Protection policies can include local Snapshot copies or remote SnapMirror protection with SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC). If you are utilizing nested consistency groups, you can set different protection policies for individual volumes.

If you are utilizing remote SM-BC protection, to ensure Snapshot copies of consistency groups created on your consistency group are copied to the destination, the policy labels in the source and destination cluster must match. SM-BC will not replicate Snapshot copies by default unless a rule with a SnapMirror label is added to the predefined AutomatedFailOver policy and the Snapshot copies are created with that label. To learn more about this process, refer to link:../task_san_configure_protection_for_business_continuity.html[Configure protection for business continuity].

Recovery can occur for an entire consistency group, a single consistency group in a hierarchical configuration, or for individual volumes within the consistency group. Recovery can be achieved by selecting the consistency group you want to recover from, selecting the Snapshot copy type, and then identifying the particular Snapshot copy to base the restoration on. For more information about this process, see link:../task_dp_restore_from_vault.html[Restore a volume from an earlier Snapshot copy].

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, System Manager visualizes LUN maps under the *Protection > Relationships* menu. When you select a source relationship, System Manager displays a visualization of the source relationships. By selecting a volume, you can delve deeper into these relationships to see a list of the contained LUNs and the initiator group relationships. This information can be downloaded as an Excel workbook from the individual volume view. The task will run in the background.

== Set a local Snapshot protection policy

.Steps
. Select the consistency group you have created from the Consistency group menu.
. At the top right of the overview page for the consistency group, select *Edit*.
. Check the box next to *Schedule Snapshot copies (local)*.
. Select a Snapshot policy. To configure a new, custom policy, refer to link:../task_dp_create_custom_data_protection_policies.html[Create a custom data protection policy].
. Select *Save*.
. Return to the consistency group overview menu. In the left column under *Snapshot Copies (Local)*, the status should say protected next to image:../media/icon_shield.png[alt=green shield icon].

== Set a remote SM-BC policy

.Steps
. Ensure you have met the prerequisites for using SM-BC. See link:../smbc/smbc_plan_prerequisites.html[SM-BC prerequisites]
+
NOTE: SM-BC relationships cannot be established on volumes mounted for NAS access.

. Select the consistency group you have created from the Consistency group menu.
. At the top right of the overview page, select *More* then *Protect*.
. The source-side information should be autofilled on the left-hand side of the page.
. Select the appropriate cluster and storage VM for the destination. Select a protection policy. Ensure that *Initialize relationship* is checked.
. Click *Save*.
. The consistency group will have to initialize and synchronize. When this is complete, under *SnapMirror (Remote)* the status should say "`Protected`" next to  image:../media/icon_shield.png[alt=green shield icon].
