[.lead]
Consistency groups offer easily managed local and remote protection for SAN, NAS, and NVMe applications that span multiple volumes.

Creating a consistency group does not automatically enable protection. Protection policies can be set at the time of creation or after creating your consistency group. You can protect consistency groups using:

* Local Snapshot policies
* SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC)
* Asynchronous SnapMirror (beginning 9.13.1)

If you are utilizing nested consistency groups, you can set different protection policies for the parent and child consistency groups.

Beginning in ONTAP 9.11.1, consistency groups offer <<two-phase,two-phase consistency group Snapshot creation>>. The two-phase Snapshot executes a precheck, ensuring the Snapshot will be captured successfully.  

Recovery can occur for an entire consistency group, a single consistency group in a hierarchical configuration, or for individual volumes within the consistency group. Recovery can be achieved by selecting the consistency group you want to recover from, selecting the Snapshot copy type, and then identifying the Snapshot copy to base the restoration on. For more information about this process, see link:../task_dp_restore_from_vault.html[Restore a volume from an earlier Snapshot copy].

== Set a local Snapshot protection policy

Setting a local snapshot protection policy allows you to create a policy spanning all volumes in a consistency group. 

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the consistency group you have created from the Consistency group menu.
. At the top right of the overview page for the consistency group, select *Edit*.
. Check the box next to *Schedule Snapshot copies (local)*.
. Select a Snapshot policy. To configure a new, custom policy, refer to link:../task_dp_create_custom_data_protection_policies.html[Create a custom data protection policy].
. Select *Save*.
. Return to the consistency group overview menu. In the left column under *Snapshot Copies (Local)*, the status will say protected next to image:../media/icon_shield.png[alt=green shield icon].

== Create two-phase consistency group snapshots [[two-phase]]

Beginning in ONTAP 9.11.1, consistency groups support two-phase commits for consistency group (CG) Snapshot creation, which execute a precheck before committing the Snapshot. This feature is only available with the ONTAP REST API.

Two-phase CG Snapshot creation is only available for Snapshot creation, not provisioning consistency groups or restoring consistency groups. 

A two-phase CG Snapshot creation breaks the Snapshot creation process invoked with a POST request to the `/application/consistency-groups/{consistency_group_uuid}/snapshots` endpoint into a sequence of two phases:

. In the first phase initiated with a POST request, the API executes prechecks, triggers Snapshot creation, and starts a timer for designated interval.
. If the POST request in phase one completes with a 201 status code, you can invoke the second phase within the designated interval from the first phase, committing the Snapshot to the appropriate endpoint.  

For more information about the ONTAP REST API, refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-automation/reference/api_reference.html[API reference^] or visit the link:https://devnet.netapp.com/restapi.php[ONTAP REST API page^] at the NetApp Developer Network for a complete list of API endpoints. 

.Before you begin
* To use two-phase CG Snapshot creation, all nodes in the cluster must be running ONTAP 9.11.1 or later. 
* Only one active invocation of a consistency group Snapshot creation operation is supported on a consistency group instance at a time, whether it be a one-phase or two-phase. Attempting to invoke a Snapshot creation while another one is in progress will result in a failure. 
* The two-phase consistency group Snapshot creation can be invoked with the `action=start` parameter.
+
You can additionally use the `action_timeout` parameter to specify the maximum number of seconds that the Snapshot creation process can take.
The `action_timeout` parameter can be set equal to an integer between 5 and 120. The default value of `action_timeout` is 7. 

[IMPORTANT]
Beginning in ONTAP 9.14.1, ONTAP has introduced commands to create a two-phase Snapshot from the CLI. Invoking the Snapshot creation from the CLI does not return the Snapshot UUID that is required for the second step in the Snapshot creation. If you want to create a two-phase Snapshot using the CLI, you should initiate the operation in the REST API and then complete the Snapshot using the `xyz` command. 

.Steps
. Invoke the Snapshot creation. Send a POST request to the consistency group endpoint using the `action=start` parameter.
+
[source,curl]
----
curl -k -X POST 'https://<IP_address>/application/consistency-groups/<cg-uuid>/snapshots?action=start&action_timeout=7' -H "accept: application/hal+json" -H "content-type: application/json" -d '
{
  "name": "<snapshot_name>",
  "consistency_type": "crash",
  "comment": "<comment>",
  "snapmirror_label": "<SnapMirror_label>"
}'
----
+
. If the POST request succeeds, your output will include a snapshot uuid. Using that uuid, submit a PATCH request to commit the Snapshot.
+
[source,curl]
----
curl -k -X PATCH 'https://<IP_address>/application/consistency-groups/<cg_uuid>/snapshots/<snapshot_id>?action=commit' -H "accept: application/hal+json" -H "content-type: application/json"
----

== Set remote protection for a consistency group

Consistency groups offer remote protection through SM-BC and, beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, asynchronous SnapMirror.

=== Configure protection with SM-BC

You can utilize SM-BC to ensure Snapshot copies of consistency groups created on your consistency group are copied to the destination. To learn more about SM-BC, refer to xref:../task_san_configure_protection_for_business_continuity.html[Configure protection for business continuity].

.Before you begin
* SM-BC relationships cannot be established on volumes mounted for NAS access.
* The policy labels in the source and destination cluster must match.
* SM-BC will not replicate Snapshot copies by default unless a rule with a SnapMirror label is added to the predefined `AutomatedFailOver` policy and the Snapshot copies are created with that label.
+
To learn more about this process, refer to link:../task_san_configure_protection_for_business_continuity.html[Configure protection for business continuity].
* Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can non-disruptively xref:modify-task.html#add-volumes-to-a-consistency-group[add volumes to a consistency group] with an active SM-BC relationship. Any other changes to a consistency group require you to break the SM-BC relationship, modify the consistency group, then reestablish and resynchronize the relationship. 

.Steps
. Ensure you have met the link:../smbc/smbc_plan_prerequisites.html[prerequisites for using SM-BC].
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the consistency group you have created from the Consistency group menu.
. At the top right of the overview page, select *More* then *Protect*.
. System Manager auto-fills source-side information. Select the appropriate cluster and storage VM for the destination. Select a protection policy. Ensure that *Initialize relationship* is checked.
. Select *Save*.
. The consistency group needs to initialize and synchronize. Confirm synchronization has completed successfully by returning to the *Consistency group* menu. The *SnapMirror (Remote)* status displays `Protected` next to image:../media/icon_shield.png[alt=green shield icon].

=== Configure asynchronous SnapMirror protection

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can configure asynchronous SnapMirror protection for a single consistency group. 

.Before you begin
* Asynchronous SnapMirror protection is only available for single consistency groups. It is not supported for hierarchical consistency groups. To convert a hierarchical consistency group into a single consistency group, see xref:modify-geometry-task.html[modify consistency group architecture].
* xref:../data-protection/supported-deployment-config-concept.html[Cascade deployments] are not supported with SM-BC. 
* The policy labels in the source and destination cluster must match.
* You can non-disruptively xref:modify-task.html#add-volumes-to-a-consistency-group[add volumes to a consistency group] with an active asynchronous SnapMirror relationship. Any other changes to a consistency group require you to break the SnapMirror relationship, modify the consistency group, then reestablish and resynchronize the relationship. 
* If you have configured an asynchronous SnapMirror protection relationship for multiple individual volumes, you can convert those volumes into a consistency group while retaining the existing Snapshots. To convert volumes successfully:
  * There must be a common Snapshot copy of the volumes.
  * You must break the existing SnapMirror relationship, xref:configure-task.html[add the volumes to a single consistency group], then resynchronize the relationship using the following workflow.  

.Steps
. From the destination cluster, select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the consistency group you have created from the Consistency group menu.
. At the top right of the overview page, select *More* then *Protect*.
. System Manager auto-fills source-side information. Select the appropriate cluster and storage VM for the destination. Select a protection policy. Ensure that *Initialize relationship* is checked.
+
When selecting an asynchronous policy, you have the option to **Override Transfer Schedule**. 
+
[NOTE]
The minimum supported schedule (recovery point objective, or RPO) for consistency groups with asynchronous SnapMirror is 30 minutes.

. Select *Save*.
. The consistency group needs to initialize and synchronize. Confirm synchronization has completed successfully by returning to the *Consistency group* menu. The *SnapMirror (Remote)* status displays `Protected` next to image:../media/icon_shield.png[alt=green shield icon].

== Visualize relationships

System Manager visualizes LUN maps under the *Protection > Relationships* menu. When you select a source relationship, System Manager displays a visualization of the source relationships. By selecting a volume, you can delve deeper into these relationships to see a list of the contained LUNs and the initiator group relationships. This information can be downloaded as an Excel workbook from the individual volume view; the download operation will run in the background.
