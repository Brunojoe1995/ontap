[.lead]
A consistency group is a collection of volumes that provides a write-order consistency guarantee for an application workload spanning multiple volumes.

Consistency groups facilitate application workload management, providing easy management of local and remote protection policies and providing simultaneous crash-consistent or application-consistent Snapshot copies of a collection of volumes at a point in time. Snapshots in consistency groups enable an entire application workload to be restored.

Consistency groups support any FlexVol volume regardless of protocol (NAS, SAN, or NVMe) and can be managed through the ONTAP REST APIs or in System Manager under the *Storage > Consistency Groups* menu item.

Consistency groups can exist on their own or in a hierarchical relationship. An individual consistency group is a collection of volumes. Volumes can have their own volume-granular snapshot policy.  In addition, the consistency group the volume is associated with can have its own snapshot policy too. The consistency group can only have one SM-BC relationship and shared SM-BC policy, which can be used to recover the entire consistency group.

Larger application workloads might require multiple consistency groups. In these situations, multiple consistency groups can be placed together in a hierarchical relationship. In this configuration, single consistency groups become the child components of a parent consistency group. The parent consistency group can include up to five child consistency groups. Like in individual consistency groups, a remote SM-BC protection policy can be applied to the entire configuration of consistency groups (parent and children) to recover the application workload.

== Protection

Consistency groups offer remote protection through SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) and local protection through Snapshot policies. In order to utilize remote protection, you must meet the requirements for xref:../smbc/smbc_plan_prerequisites.html#licensing[SnapMirror Business Continuity deployments]. By default, consistency groups do not have a protection policy set and will not protect your data unless a policy is selected. See link:protect-task.html[“Protect a consistency group”] for more information.

NOTE: SM-BC relationships cannot be established on volumes mounted for NAS access.

Beginning in ONTAP 9.11.1, there is additional support for consistency groups with link:protect-task.html#two-phase-CG-snapshot-creation[two-phase consistency group snapshot creation].


== Consistency groups in MetroCluster configurations

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can provision consistency groups with new volumes on a cluster within a MetroCluster configuration. These volumes are provisioned on mirrored aggregates.

After they are provisioned, you can move volumes associated with consistency groups between mirrored and unmirrored aggregates. Therefore, they can be located on mirrored aggregates, unmirrored aggregates, or both.

You can modify mirrored aggregates containing volumes associated with consistency groups to become unmirrored.  Similarly, you can modify unmirrored aggregates containing volumes associated with consistency groups to enable mirroring.

Volumes associated with consistency groups placed on mirrored aggregates and their Snapshots, including any consistency group Snapshots, are replicated to the remote site (site B). The contents of the volumes on site B are consistency group semantics-compliant. You can access replicated consistency group Snapshots using consistency group Snapshot REST APIs and System Manager on clusters running ONTAP 9.11.1 or later.

GET and DELETE operations on consistency groups, that have some or all their associated volumes located on unmirrored aggregates that are not currently accessible, behave like local volumes associated with a consistency group or their hosting aggregates that are offline.

=== Consistency group configuration replication

The consistency group configurations are only replicated to site B, if site B is also running ONTAP 9.11.1 or later.
If site B is running ONTAP 9.10.1 or earlier, none of the consistency groups themselves on site A are replicated to site B.  However, any volumes associated with those consistency groups that are placed on mirrored aggregates will follow the MetroCluster process and continue to be replicated to site B. After site B is upgraded to ONTAP 9.11.1, data for consistency groups on site A, that have all their associated volumes placed on mirrored aggregates, are replicated to site B.

== Upgrade considerations

Consistency groups created with SM-BC in ONTAP 9.8 and 9.9.1 will automatically be upgraded and become manageable under *Storage > Consistency Groups* in System Manager or the ONTAP REST API when upgrading to ONTAP 9.10.1. For more information about upgrading, see link:../smbc/smbc_admin_upgrade_and_revert_considerations.html[SM-BC upgrade and revert considerations].

Consistency group snapshots created with the ONTAP REST API can be managed through System Manager’s Consistency Group interface and through consistency group API endpoints.

[Note]
Snapshots created with the ONTAPI commands `cg-start` and `cg-commit` will not be recognized as consistency group Snapshots and thus cannot be managed through System Manager's Consistency Group interface or the consistency group endpoints in the ONTAP API.
