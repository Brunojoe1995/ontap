Beginning in ONTAP 9.12.1, you can clone a consistency group to create a copy of a consistency group and its contents. Cloning a consistency group creates a copy of the consistency group configuration, its metadata such as application type, and all the volumes and its contents such as files, directories, LUNs or NVMe namespaces. 

When cloning a consistency group, you can clone it with its current configuration, but with volume contents as they are or based on an existing consistency group Snapshot.

Cloning a consistency group is supported only for the entire consistency group. You cannot clone an individual child consistency group in a hierarchical relationship: only the complete consistency group configuration can be cloned. 

When you clone a consistency group, the following components are not cloned:

- iGroups
- LUN maps
- NVMe subsystems
- NVMe namespace subsystem maps

When you clone a consistency group, ONTAP will not create SMB shares for the cloned volumes if a share name is not specified. Cloned consistency groups are not mounted if a junction path is not specified. If you attempt to clone a consistency group based on a Snapshot that does not reflect the consistency group's current configuration, the operation will fail. 

After you clone a consistency group, you need to perform the appropriate mapping operation. Refer to xref:../task_san_map_igroups_to_multiple_luns.html[Map igroups to multiple LUNs] or xref:../san-admin/map-nvme-namespace-subsystem-task.html[Map an NVMe namespace to a subsystem] for more information. 

Cloning a consistency group is not supported for a consistency group in a SnapMirror Business Continuity relationship or with any associated DP volumes. 

.Steps 
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the consistency group you want to clone from the *Consistency Group* menu.
. At the top right of the overview page for the consistency group, select *Clone*.
. Enter a name for the new, cloned consistency group or accept the default name.
.. Choose if you want to enable link:../concepts/thin-provisioning-concept.html[*Thin Provisioning*^].
.. Choose *Split Clone* if you want to dissociate the consistency group from its source and allocate additional disk space for the cloned consistency group.
. To clone the consistency group in its current state, choose *Add a new Snapshot copy*. 
+
To clone the consistency group based on a snapshot, choose *Use an existing Snapshot copy*. Selecting this option will open a new sub-menu. Choose the Snapshot that you want to use as the basis for the clone operation.
. Select *Clone*.
. Return to the *Consistency Group* menu to confirm your consistency group has been cloned.
