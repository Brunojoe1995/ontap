[.lead]
Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can modify the geometry of a consistency group. Modifying the geometry of a consistency group enables you to alter the configuration of child or parent consistency groups without disruption to ongoing IO operations.

Modifying consistency group geometry will have an impact on existing snapshot copies. 

[NOTE]
You cannot modify the geometry of a consistency group that is configured with a remote protection policy. You must first break the protection relationship, modify the geometry, then restore remote protection. 

== Add a new child consistency group

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can add a new child consistency group to an existing parent consistency group. 

.Before you begin
* A parent consistency group can contain a maximum of five child consistency groups. See xref:limits.html[consistency group limits] for other limits. 
* You cannot add a child consistency group to a single consistency group. You must first <<promote>> the consistency group, then you can add a child consistency group. 
* Existing Ssapshot copies of the consistency group captured before the expand operation will be considered partial. Any restore operation based on that snapshot copy will reflect the consistency group at the point-in-time of the Snapshot copy. 
 
.Steps 
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the parent consistency group you want to which you want to add a child consistency group.
. Next to the parent consistency group's name, select **More** then **Add new child consistency group**. 
. Enter a name for your consistency group. 
. Choose whether you would like to add new or existing volumes.
.. If you are adding existing volumes, select **Existing volumes** then choose the volumes from the dropdown menu. 
.. If you are adding new volumes, select **New volumes** then designate the number of volumes and their size. 
. Select **Add**. 

[[detach, detach]]
== Detach a child consistency group 

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can remove a child consistency group from its parent, converting it into an individual consistency group. 

.Before you begin
* Detaching a child consistency group causes the parent consistency groupâ€™s snapshots to become invalid and inaccessible. Volume granular snapshots remain valid.
* Existing Snapshot copies of the individual consistency group remain valid. 

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the parent consistency group that contains the child you want to detach. 
. Next to the child consistency group you want to detach, select **More** then **Detach from parent**.
. Optionally, rename the consistency group and select an application type. 
. Select **Detach**. 

== Move a single consistency group under a parent consistency group

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can convert an existing single consistency group to a child consistency group. You can either move the consistency group under an existing parent consistency group or create a new parent consistency group during the move operation. 

.Before you begin
* The parent consistency group must have four or fewer children. A parent consistency group can contain a maximum of five child consistency groups. See xref:limits.html[consistency group limits] for other limits. 
* Existing snapshot copies of the _parent_ consistency group captured before this operation will be considered partial. Any restore operation based on one of those Snapshot copies will reflect the consistency group at the point-in-time of the Snapshot copy. 
* Existing consistency group snapshots of the single consistency group remain valid.

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the consistency group you want to convert. 
. Select **More** then **Move under different consistency group**. 
. Optionally, enter a new name for the consistency group and select a component type. By default, the component type will be Other.
. Choose if you want to migrate to an existing parent consistency group or create a new parent consistency group:
.. To migrate to an existing parent consistency group, select **Existing consistency group** then choose the consistency group from the dropdown menu.
.. To create a new parent consistency group, select **New consistency group** then provide a name for the new consistency group.
. Select **Move**.

[[promote, promote]]
== Promote a child consistency group

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can promote a single consistency group to a parent consistency group. When you promote the single consistency group to a parent, you also create a new child consistency group that inherits all of the volumes in the original, single consistency group. 

.Before you begin
* If you want to convert a child consistency group to a parent consistency group, you must first <<detach>> the child consistency group then follow this procedure. 
* Existing Snapshot copies of the consistency group remain valid after you promote the consistency group. 

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the consistency group you want to promote. 
. Select **More** then **Promote to parent consistency group**.
. Enter a **Name** and select a **Component type** for the child consistency group.
. Select **Promote**. 

== Demote a parent to a single consistency group

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can demote a parent consistency group to a single consistency group. Demoting the parent flattens the hierarchy of the consistency group, removing all associated child consistency groups. All volumes in the consistency group will remain under the new, single consistency group. 

.Before you begin
* Existing Snapshot copies of the consistency group will remain valid after you demote the parent consistency group to a single consistency group.

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the parent consistency group you want to demote.
. Select **More** then **Demote to single consistency group**.
. A warning will advise you that all associated child consistency groups will be deleted and their volumes will be moved under the new, single consistency group. Select **Demote** to confirm you understand the impact.
