The networking reference documentation describes how to configure and manage physical and virtual network ports (VLANs and interface groups), LIFs using IPv4 and IPv6, routing, and host-resolution services in clusters; optimize network traffic by load balancing; and monitor the cluster by using SNMP. Unless otherwise stated, this information applies to all versions of ONTAP 9.
