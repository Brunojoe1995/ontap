You can assign service policies (instead of LIF roles) to LIFs that determine the kind of traffic that is supported for the LIFs. Service policies define a collection of network services supported by a LIF. ONTAP provides a set of built-in service policies that can be associated with a LIF.

You can display service policies and their details using the following command:
`network interface service-policy show`

== Service policies for system SVMs

The admin SVM and any system SVM contain service policies that can be used for LIFs in that SVM, including management and intercluster LIFs. These policies are automatically created by the system when an IPspace is created.

The following table lists the built-in policies for LIFs in system SVMs as of ONTAP 9.10.1. For other releases, display the service policies and their details using the following command:

`network interface service-policy show`

Note: Service intercluster-core is available from ONTAP 9.5 with the name net-intercluster service policy.
a|default-route-announce

a|management-core, management-https, management-http, management-ssh management-autosupport, management-ems, management-ntp-client, management-snmp-server, management-ntp-server, backup-ndmp-control
a|node-mgmt, or cluster-mgmt
a|Used by LIFs handling system-scoped management requests. Management-ems controls which LIFs can publish EMS content.
The system-scoped management policy is used to create node-scoped and cluster-scoped management LIFs owned by a system SVM. These LIFs can be used for outbound connections to NTP or DNS servers as well as some additional connections to support applications run on behalf of the entire system.

== Service policies for data SVMs

All data SVMs contain service policies that can be used by LIFs in that SVM.

|===

You should be aware of how the service policies are assigned to the LIFs in data SVMs:

* If a data SVM is created with a list of data services, the built-in "default-data-files" and "default-data-blocks" service policies in that SVM are created using the specified services.
* If a data SVM is created without specifying a list of data services, the built-in "default-data-files" and "default-data-blocks" service policies in that SVM are created using a default list of data services.
+
The default data services list includes the iSCSI, NFS, SMB, and FlexCache services.
* When a LIF is created with a list of data protocols, a service policy equivalent to the specified data protocols is assigned to the LIF.
+
If an equivalent service policy does not exist, a custom service policy is created.
* When a LIF is created without a service policy or list of data protocols, the default-data-files service policy is assigned to the LIF by default.

== Data-core service

The data-core service allows components that previously used LIFs with the data role to work as expected on clusters that have been upgraded to manage LIFs using service policies instead of LIF roles (which are deprecated in ONTAP 9.6).

Specifying data-core as a service does not open any ports in the firewall, but the service should be included in any service policy in a data SVM. For example, the default-data-files service policy contains the following services by default:

* data-core
* data-nfs
* data-cifs
* data-flexcache

The data-core service should be included in the policy to ensure all applications using the LIF work as expected, but the other three services can be removed, if desired.

== Client-side LIF service

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, ONTAP provides client-side LIF services for multiple applications. These services provide control over which LIFs are used for outbound connections on behalf of each application.

The following new services give administrators control over which LIFs are used as source addresses for certain applications.

[cols="25,25,50"]
|===

h|Service h|SVM restrictions h|Description

a|management-ntp-client
a|system-only
a|Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, ONTAP provides NTP client service for outbound connections to an external NTP server.
a|data-fpolicy-client
a|data-only
a|Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, ONTAP provides client service for outbound FPolicy connections.

|===

Each of the new services are automatically included in some of the built-in service policies, but administrators can remove them from the built-in policies or add them to custom policies to control which LIFs are used for outbound connections on behalf of each application.
