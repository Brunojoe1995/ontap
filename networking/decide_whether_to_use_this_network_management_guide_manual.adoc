This procedure describes the NAS path failover workflow for ONTAP 9.0 to 9.7 releases.

You should use this procedure under the following circumstances:

* You want to use NAS path failover best practices in a workflow that simplifies network configuration.
* You want to use the CLI, not System Manager.
* You are configuring networking on a new system running ONTAP 9.8 or later.

If you are running an ONTAP release later than 9.7, you should refer to:

* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/set_up_nas_path_failover_98_and_later_cli.html[ONTAP 9.8 and later NAS Path Failover Workflow^]

If you want network management details, you should refer to:

* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking-reference/index.html[ONTAP 9 Network Management Reference^]

If you want to use System Manager to configure the network for ONTAP 9.7 and later, you should choose the following documentation:

*	link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/[System Manager docs^]

If you require additional configuration or conceptual information, you should choose among the following documentation:
