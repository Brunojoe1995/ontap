You can perform basic storage network administration, such as configuring physical and virtual network ports (VLANs and interface groups), creating LIFs using IPv4 and IPv6, managing routing and host-resolution services in clusters, balancing loads to optimize network traffic, and monitoring a cluster using SNMP.

You should use this information under the following circumstances:

* You want to understand the range of ONTAP network management capabilities.
* You want to use the CLI, not System Manager.
* You are configuring networking on a new or upgraded system running ONTAP 9.

If you want to follow NAS path failover best practices and are running an ONTAP 9.8 or later release, you should use the following documentation:

* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/set_up_nas_path_failover_98_and_later_cli.html[ONTAP 9.8 and later NAS Path Failover Workflow^]

If you want to follow NAS path failover best practices and are running an ONTAP 9.0 - 9.7 release, you should use the following documentation:

* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking-manual-config/index.html[ONTAP 9.0 - 9.7 NAS Path Failover Workflow^]

If you want to use System Manager to configure the network for ONTAP 9.7 and later, you should choose the following documentation:

*	link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/[System Manager docs^]

If you require additional configuration or conceptual information, you should choose among the following documentation:

* Conceptual background for network configuration
** link:../concepts/index.html[ONTAP concepts^]
* NAS file access
** link:../nfs-admin/index.html[NFS management^]
** link:../smb-admin/index.html[SMB management^]
* SAN host provisioning
** link:../san-admin/index.html[SAN administration^]
* Command reference

* Technical Reports (TRs), which include additional information about ONTAP technology and interaction with external services
