You can add network ports when initially creating a broadcast domain, or you can add ports to, or remove ports from, a broadcast domain that already exists. This allows you to efficiently use all the ports in the cluster.

.Before you begin

* Ports you plan to add to a broadcast domain must not belong to another broadcast domain.
* Ports that already belong to an interface group cannot be added individually to a broadcast domain.

.About this task

The following rules apply when adding and removing network ports:

|===

h| When adding ports... h| When removing ports...

| The ports can be network ports, VLANs, or interface groups (ifgrps).
| N/A
| The ports are added to the system-defined failover group of the broadcast domain.
| The ports are removed from all failover groups in the broadcast domain.
| The MTU of the ports is updated to the MTU value set in the broadcast domain.
| The MTU of the ports is unchanged.
| The IPspace of the ports is updated to the IPspace value of the broadcast domain.
| The ports are moved to the 'Default' IPspace with no broadcast domain attribute.
|===

[NOTE]
If you remove the last member port of an interface group using the `network port ifgrp remove-port` command, it causes the interface group port to be removed from the broadcast domain because an empty interface group port is not allowed in a broadcast domain.

.Steps

. Display the ports that are currently assigned or unassigned to a broadcast domain by using the `network port show` command.
. Add or remove network ports from the broadcast domain:

== Examples of adding and removing ports

The following command adds port e0g on node cluster-1-01 and port e0g on node cluster-1-02 to broadcast domain bcast1 in the Default IPspace:

`cluster-1::> network port broadcast-domain add-ports -broadcast-domain bcast1 -ports cluster-1-01:e0g,cluster1-02:e0g`

The following command adds two cluster ports to broadcast domain Cluster in the Cluster IPspace:

`cluster-1::> network port broadcast-domain add-ports -broadcast-domain Cluster -ports cluster-2-03:e0f,cluster2-04:e0f -ipspace Cluster`

The following command removes port e0e on node cluster1-01 from broadcast domain bcast1 in the Default IPspace:

`cluster-1::> network port broadcast-domain remove-ports -broadcast-domain bcast1 -ports cluster-1-01:e0e`
