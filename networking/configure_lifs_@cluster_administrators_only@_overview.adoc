A LIF (logical interface) represents a network access point to a node in the cluster. You can configure LIFs on ports over which the cluster sends and receives communications over the network.

A cluster administrator can create, view, modify, migrate, revert, or delete LIFs. An SVM administrator can only view the LIFs associated with the SVM.

A LIF is an IP address or WWPN with associated characteristics, such as a service policy, a home port, a home node, a list of ports to fail over to, and a firewall policy. You can configure LIFs on ports over which the cluster sends and receives communications over the network.

NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, firewall policies are deprecated and wholly replaced with LIF service policies. For more information, see link:../networking/configure_firewall_policies_for_lifs.html[Configure firewall policies for LIFs].

LIFs can be hosted on the following ports:

* Physical ports that are not part of interface groups
* Interface groups
* VLANs
* Physical ports or interface groups that host VLANs
* Virtual IP (VIP) ports
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.5, VIP LIFs are supported and are hosted on VIP ports.

While configuring SAN protocols such as FC on a LIF, it will be associated with a WWPN.
