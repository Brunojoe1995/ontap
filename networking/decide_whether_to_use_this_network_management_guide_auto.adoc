This guide describes the NAS path failover workflow for ONTAP 9.8 and later releases.

You should use this guide under the following circumstances:

* You want to use NAS path failover best practices in a workflow that simplifies network configuration.
* You want to use the CLI, not System Manager.
* You are configuring networking on a new system running ONTAP 9.8 or later.

If you are running an ONTAP release earlier than 9.8, you should use the following NAS path failover documentation:

* link:../networking-manual-config/index.html[ONTAP 9.0 - 9.7 NAS Path Failover Workflow^]

If you want network management details, you should use the following ONTAP 9 Network Management Reference:

* link:../networking/index.html[ONTAP 9 Network Management Reference^]

If you want to use System Manager to configure the network for ONTAP 9.7 and later, you should choose the following documentation:

*	link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/[System Manager docs^]

If you require additional configuration or conceptual information, you should choose among the following documentation:

* Conceptual background for network configuration
** link:../concepts/index.html[ONTAP concepts^]
* NAS file access
** link:../nfs-admin/index.html[NFS management^]
** link:../smb-admin/index.html[SMB management^]
* SAN host provisioning
** link:../san-admin/index.html[SAN administration^]
* Command reference

* Technical Reports (TRs), which include additional information about ONTAP technology and interaction with external services
