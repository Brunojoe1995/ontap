If multiple routes have the same metric for a destination, only one of the routes is picked for outgoing traffic. This leads to other routes being unutilized for sending outgoing traffic. You can enable multipath routing to load balance across all available routes in proportion to their metrics, as opposed to ECMP routing, which load balances across available routes of the same metric.

.Steps

. Log in to the advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`

. Enable multipath routing:
+
`network options multipath-routing modify -is-enabled true`
+
Multipath routing is enabled for all nodes in the cluster.

....
network options multipath-routing modify -is-enabled true
....
