You can use an IPspace to create a distinct IP address space for each SVM in a cluster. Doing so enables clients in administratively separate network domains to access cluster data while using overlapping IP addresses from the same IP address subnet range.

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.Step

. Create an IPspace.
+
`network ipspace create -ipspace ipspace1`
+
`network ipspace show`
+
....
IPspace             Vserver List          Broadcast Domains
------------------- --------------------- ----------------------------
Cluster             Cluster               Cluster
Default             Cluster1              Default
ipspace1            ipspace1              -
....
+
The IPspace is created, along with the system SVM for the IPspace. The system SVM carries management traffic.
