[.lead]
You must create a broadcast domain for a custom IPspace. The SVMs created in the IPspace use the ports in the broadcast domain.

NOTE: This task is relevant for ONTAP 9.0 - 9.7, not ONTAP 9.8.

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.About this task

The port to which a LIF fails over must be a member of the failover group for the LIF. When you create a broadcast domain, ONTAP automatically creates a failover group with the same name. The failover group contains all the ports assigned to the broadcast domain.

.Steps

. Create a broadcast domain.
+
`network port broadcast-domain create -ipspace ipspace1 -broadcast-domain -ipspace1 -mtu 1500 -ports node1:e0d,node1:e0e,node2:e0d,node2:e0e`
. Verify that the broadcast domain configuration is correct.
.. Verify the broadcast domain is correct:
+
`network port broadcast-domain show`
.. Verify the network port is correct:
+
`network port show`
.. Verify the failover group names and failover targets are correct:
+
`network interface failover-groups show`
