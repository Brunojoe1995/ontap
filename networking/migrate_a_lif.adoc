You might have to migrate a LIF to a different port on the same node or a different node within the cluster, if the port is either faulty or requires maintenance. Migrating a LIF is similar to LIF failover, but LIF migration is a manual operation, while LIF failover is the automatic migration of a LIF in response to a link failure on the LIF's current network port.

.Before you begin

* A failover group must have been configured for the LIFs.
* The destination node and ports must be operational and must be able to access the same network as the source port.

.About this task

* BGP LIFs reside on the home-port and cannot be migrated to any other node or port.
* You must migrate LIFs hosted on the ports belonging to a NIC to other ports in the cluster, before removing the NIC from the node.
* You must execute the command for migrating a cluster LIF from the node where the cluster LIF is hosted.
* A node-scoped LIF, such as a node-scoped management LIF, cluster LIF, intercluster LIF, cannot be migrated to a remote node.
* When an NFSv4 LIF is migrated between nodes, a delay of up to 45 seconds results before the LIF is available on a new port.
+
To work around this problem, use NFSv4.1 where no delay is encountered.
* You cannot migrate iSCSI LIFs from one node to another node.
+
To work around this restriction, you must create an iSCSI LIF on the destination node. For information about guidelines for creating an iSCSI LIF, see link:../san-admin/index.html[SAN administration^].

* VMware VAAI copy offload operations fail when you migrate the source or the destination LIF. For more information about VMware VAAI, see http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.cdot-famg-nfs/GUID-39C8E616-EAE8-46A4-881A-87C4B8421281.html[NFS reference^] or http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-sanag/GUID-D97EE182-9068-4BD8-A3BF-F5C458303740.html[SAN administration^].

.Step

Depending on whether you want to migrate a specific LIF or all the LIFs, perform the appropriate action:

|===

h| If you want to migrate... h| Enter the following command...

a|A specific LIF
a|`network interface migrate`
a|All the data and cluster- management LIFs on a node
a|`network interface migrate-all`
a|All of the LIFs off of a port
a|`network interface migrate-all -node <node> -port <port>`
|===

The following example shows how to migrate a LIF named datalif1 on the SVM vs0 to the port e0d on node0b:

....
network interface migrate -vserver vs0 -lif datalif1 -dest-node node0b -dest-port e0d
....

The following example shows how to migrate all the data and cluster-management LIFs from the current (local) node:

....
network interface migrate-all -node local
....
