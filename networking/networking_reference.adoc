You can use the following information to perform basic storage network administration. You can configure physical and virtual network ports (VLANs and interface groups), create LIFs using IPv4 and IPv6, manage routing and host-resolution services in clusters, use load balancing to optimize network traffic, and monitor a cluster using SNMP.

Unless otherwise stated, these procedures apply to all versions of ONTAP 9.

You should use these procedures under the following circumstances:

* You want to understand the range of ONTAP network management capabilities.
* You want to use the CLI, not System Manager.
