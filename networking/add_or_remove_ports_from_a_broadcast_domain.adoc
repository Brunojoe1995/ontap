Broadcast domains are automatically created during the cluster create or join operation. You do not need to manually remove ports from broadcast domains.

If network port reachability has changed, either through physical network connectivity or switch configuration, and a network port belongs in a different broadcast domain, see the following topic:

.System Manager
--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can use System Manager to reassign Ethernet ports across broadcast domains. It is recommended that you assign every Ethernet port to a broadcast domain. So, if you unassign an Ethernet port from a broadcast domain, you must reassign it to a different broadcast domain.

.Steps

To reassign Ethernet ports, perform the following steps:

. Select *Network > Overview*.

. In the *Broadcast Domains* section, select image:icon_kabob.gif[menu icon] next to the domain name.

. In the drop-down menu, select *Edit*.

. On the *Edit Broadcast Domain* page, deselect the Ethernet ports that you want to reassign to another domain.

. For each deselected port, the *Reassign Ethernet Port* window displays. Select the broadcast domain to which you want to reassign the port, and then select *Reassign*.

. Select all the ports that you want to assign to the current broadcast domain and save your changes.

You cannot use the CLI to manually add or remove ports from a broadcast domain. 

If network port reachability has changed, either through physical network connectivity or switch configuration, and a network port belongs in a different broadcast domain, see the following topic:
