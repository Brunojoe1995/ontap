VLANs provide logical segmentation of networks by creating separate broadcast domains that are defined on a switch port basis as opposed to the traditional broadcast domains, defined on physical boundaries.

A VLAN can span multiple physical network segments. The end-stations belonging to a VLAN are related by function or application.

For example, end-stations in a VLAN might be grouped by departments, such as engineering and accounting, or by projects, such as release1 and release2. Because physical proximity of the end- stations is not essential in a VLAN, you can disperse the end-stations geographically and still contain the broadcast domain in a switched network.

You can manage VLANs by creating, deleting, or displaying information about them.

[NOTE]
You should not create a VLAN on a network interface with the same identifier as the native VLAN of the switch. For example, if the network interface e0b is on native VLAN 10, you should not create a VLAN e0b-10 on that interface.

== Create a VLAN

You can create a VLAN for maintaining separate broadcast domains within the same network domain by using the `network port vlan create` command.

.Before you begin

Your network administrator must have confirmed that the following requirements have been met:

* The switches deployed in the network must either comply with IEEE 802.1Q standards or have a vendor-specific implementation of VLANs.
* For supporting multiple VLANs, an end-station must be statically configured to belong to one or more VLANs.
* The VLAN is not attached to a port hosting a cluster LIF.
* The VLAN is not attached to ports assigned to the Cluster IPspace.
* The VLAN is not created on an interface group port that contains no member ports.

.About this task

In certain circumstances, if you want to create the VLAN port on a degraded port without correcting the hardware issue or any software misconfiguration, then you can set the `-ignore- health-status` parameter of the `network port modify` command as true.

Creating a VLAN attaches the VLAN to the network port on a specified node in a cluster.

When you configure a VLAN over a port for the first time, the port might go down, resulting in a temporary disconnection of the network. Subsequent VLAN additions to the same port do not affect the port state.

[NOTE]
You should not create a VLAN on a network interface with the same identifier as the native VLAN of the switch. For example, if the network interface e0b is on native VLAN 10, you should not create a VLAN e0b-10 on that interface.

.Step

. Use the `network port vlan create` command to create a VLAN.

. You must specify either the `vlan-name` or the `port` and `vlan-id` options when creating a VLAN.
The VLAN name is a combination of the name of the port (or interface group) and the network switch VLAN identifier, with a hyphen in between. For example, `e0c-24` and `e1c-80` are valid VLAN names.

The following example shows how to create a VLAN `e1c-80` attached to network port `e1c` on the node `cluster-1-01`:

....
network port vlan create -node cluster-1-01 -vlan-name e1c-80
....

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, VLANs are automatically placed into appropriate broadcast domains about one minute after their creation. If you do not want ONTAP to do this, and prefer to manually place the VLAN into a broadcast domain, then specify the `-skip-broadcast-domain-placement` parameter as part of the `vlan create` command.

For more information about this command, see http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-cmpr/GUID-5CB10C70-AC11-41C0-8C16-B4D0DF916E9B.html[ONTAP 9 commands^].

== Delete a VLAN

You might have to delete a VLAN before removing a NIC from its slot. When you delete a VLAN, it is automatically removed from all of the failover rules and groups that use it.

.Before you begin

Make sure there are no LIFs associated with the VLAN.

.About this task

Deletion of the last VLAN from a port might cause a temporary disconnection of the network from the port.

.Step

Use the `network port vlan delete` command to delete a VLAN.

The following example shows how to delete VLAN `e1c-80` from network port `e1c` on the node `cluster-1-01`:

....
network port vlan delete -node cluster-1-01 -vlan-name e1c-80
....
