You can diagnose problems on your network by using commands such as `ping, traceroute, ndp,` and `tcpdump`. You can also use commands such as `ping6` and `traceroute6` to diagnose IPv6 problems.

h|If you want to... h|Enter this command...

|Test whether the node can reach other hosts on your network
|network ping
|Test whether the node can reach other hosts on your IPv6 network
|network ping6
|Trace the route that the IPv4 packets take to a network node
|network traceroute

|network traceroute6
|Manage the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
|network ndp
|Display statistics about packets that are received and sent on a specified network interface or on all network interfaces
|run -node node_name ifstat

*Note*: This command is available from the nodeshell.
|Display information about neighboring devices that are discovered from each node and port in the cluster, including the remote device type and device platform
|network device-discovery show
|View the CDP neighbors of the node (ONTAP supports only CDPv1 advertisements)
|run -node node_name cdpd show-neighbors

*Note*: This command is available from the nodeshell.
|Trace the packets that are sent and received in the network
|network tcpdump start -node node-name - port port_name

*Note*: This command is available from the nodeshell.
