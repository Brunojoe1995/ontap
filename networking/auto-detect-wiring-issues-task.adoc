ONTAP can automatically detect and recommend solutions to network wiring issues based on a broadcast domain constituent's (ethernet ports) layer-2 reachability.

Incorrect wiring during cluster setup or when a new node joins an existing cluster might cause an unexpected broadcast domain port assignment. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, the cluster automatically checks for network wiring issues by verifying port reachability after cluster setup or when a new node joins an existing cluster.

If a port reachability issue is detected, System Manager recommends a repair operation to resolve the issue.

After you set up the cluster, network wiring issues are reported on the Dashboard.

After joining a new node to a cluster, network wiring issues appear on the Nodes page.

You can also view network wiring health on the network diagram. Port reachability issues are indicated on the network diagram by a red error icon.

== Post cluster setup

After you set up the cluster, if the system detects a network wiring issue, a message appears on the Dashboard.

.Steps

.	Correct the wiring as suggested in the message.
.	Click the link to launch the Update Broadcast Domains dialog.
The Update Broadcast Domains dialog opens.

.	Review the information about the port, including the node, the issues, the current broadcast domain, and the expected broadcast domain.
.	Select the ports that you want to repair and click *Fix*.
The system will move the ports from the current broadcast domain into the expected broadcast domain.

== Post node join

After joining a new node to a cluster, if the system detects a network wiring issue, a message appears on the Nodes page.
