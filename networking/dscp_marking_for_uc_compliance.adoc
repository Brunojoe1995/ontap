You can enable differentiated services code point (DSCP) marking on outgoing (egress) IP packet traffic for a given protocol with a default or user-provided DSCP code. DSCP marking is a mechanism for classifying and managing network traffic and is a component of Unified Capability (UC) compliance.

DSCP marking (also known as _QoS marking_ or _quality of service marking_) is enabled by providing an IPspace, protocol, and DSCP value. The protocols on which DSCP marking can be applied are NFS, SMB, iSCSI, SnapMirror, NDMP, FTP, HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, Telnet, and SNMP.

If you do not provide a DSCP value when enabling DSCP marking for a given protocol, a default is used:

* The default value for data protocols/traffic is 0x0A (10).
* The default value for control protocols/traffic is 0x30 (48).
