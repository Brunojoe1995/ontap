This workflow guides you through the networking configuration steps to set up NAS path failover for ONTAP 9.8 and later. This workflow assumes the following:

* You want to use NAS path failover best practices in a workflow that simplifies network configuration.
* You want to use the CLI, not System Manager.
* You are configuring networking on a new system running ONTAP 9.8 or later.

If you are running an ONTAP release earlier than 9.8, you should use the following NAS path failover procedure for ONTAP 9.0 to 9.7:

If you want network management details, you should use the network management reference material:
