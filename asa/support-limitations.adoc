You should use the tested and supported maximum configuration limits established for AFF All SAN Array (ASA) controllers.

For reliable operations, you should not exceed the current tested and supported limits listed in link:https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe^].

== ASA configuration limits

Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1 AFF ASA controllers can support up to 12 nodes for non-MetroCluster IP configurations and up to 8 nodes for MetroCluster IP configurations.

Also beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, NVMe-oF protocol is supported on all AFF ASA controllers except those configured for MetroCluster.  Metrocluster configurations do not support NVMe-oF.

== Support for persistent ports

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, persistent ports are enabled by default on All SAN Arrays (ASAs) that are configured to use the FC protocol. Persistent ports are only available for FC and require zone membership identified by World Wide Port Name (WWPN).

Persistent ports reduce the impact of takeovers by creating a shadow LIF on the corresponding physical port of the HA partner. When a node is taken over, the shadow LIF on the partner node assumes the identity of the original LIF, including the WWPNe. Before the status of path to the taken over node is changed to faulty, the shadow LIF appears as an Active/Optimized path to the host MPIO stack, and I/O is shifted. This reduces I/O disruption because the host always sees the same number of paths to the target, even during storage failover operations.

For persistent ports, the following FCP port characteristics should be identical within the HA pair:

* FCP port counts
* FCP port names
* FCP port speeds
* FCP LIF WWPN-based zoning

If any of these characteristics are not identical within the HA pair, the following EMS message is generated:

`EMS : scsiblade.lif.persistent.ports.fcp.init.error`

For more information on persistent ports, see link:http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4080.pdf[NetApp Technical Report 4080: Best Practices for Scalable SAN ONTAP 9^].

== Support for NVMe-oF protocol

Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, All SAN Arrays support NVMe-oF protocol.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, 4-node MetroCluster IP configurations support NVMe/FC. MetroCluster configurations are not supported for NVMe prior to 9.12.1.
