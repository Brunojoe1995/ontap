The System Manager dashboard offers a quick and comprehensive view of your cluster from a single centralized location.

Using the System Manager dashboard, you can view at-a-glance information about important alerts and notifications, the efficiency and capacity of storage tiers and volumes, the nodes that are available in a cluster, the status of the nodes in a high-availability (HA) pair, the most active applications and objects, and the performance metrics of a cluster or a node.

The dashboard includes four distinct panels described as follows:

== Health

The Health view displays information on the overall health of your cluster. You can see all the discovered nodes on the cluster that are active. 

The Health view also displays the errors and warnings at a cluster level, such as unconfigured node details, indicating the characteristics that can be modified to enhance cluster performance.

Click image:icon_arrow.gif[arrow icon] to expand the Health view to obtain an overview of the cluster such as the name of the cluster, the version, the date and time of creation of the cluster, and more. You can also monitor the statistics related to the health of the nodes associated with a cluster. You can manage tags that let you group and identify resources in your environment. The Insights section helps you optimize the capacity, security compliance, and configuration of your system.

== Capacity

The Capacity View displays the storage space of a cluster.  You can view the total logical space used, total physical space used, and the available disk space. 

You can choose to register with ActiveIQ to view historical cluster data.
Click image:icon_arrow.gif[arrow icon] to expand the Capacity view to see an overview of the tiers associated with a cluster. You can view capacity information about each of the tiers: the total space, used space, and available space. Details are displayed for throughput, IOPS, and latency.  To learn more about the measurements, refer to link:/concepts/capacity-measurements-in-sm-concept.html[Capacity measurements in System Manager].

You can choose to add a local tier or a cloud tier using the Capacity view.  For more information about the Capacity view, refer to link:task_admin_monitor_capacity_in_sm.html[View the capacity of a cluster].

== Network

The Network view displays the physical ports, network interfaces, and storage VMs that are part of the network. 

The Network view displays the type of clients connected to the network. Each of these network elements are represented by a number, for example “NVMe/FC 16”. Click on the number to view specific details on each of these network elements.

== Performance

The Performance view displays the performance statistics of a cluster at a glance which helps to monitor the health and efficiency of the cluster. The statistics include key cluster performance indicators such as latency, throughput, and IOPS, represented as graphs. 

The Performance view displays the performance statistics at different time intervals by day, hour, week, or year. You can quickly analyze cluster performance by using the various graphs and identify the characteristics that might require optimization. This quick analysis helps you decide how you might add or move workloads. You can also look at peak usage times to plan for potential changes.

For ONTAP 9.14.1 and earlier, the performance view displays the total performance metrics related to latency, throughput, and IOPS.

Beginning with 9.15.1, the performance view is enhanced to display graphs for read, write, other, and total performance metrics related to latency, throughput, and IOPS.

If the information about cluster performance cannot be retrieved from ONTAP, you cannot view the respective graph. In such cases, System Manager displays the specific error message.

The performance values refresh every 3 seconds and the performance graph refreshes every 15 seconds

Click `>` to see a full-page view of the performance metrics by hour, day, week, month, and year. You can also download a report of the performance metrics in your local system.
