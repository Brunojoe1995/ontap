To collect and display usage data, you must enable File System Analytics (FSA). You can do so using System Manager, the ONTAP CLI, or the ONTAP REST API.

You can enable File System Analytics when you create a new volume, or when you upgrade a system with volumes to ONTAP 9.8 or later. After upgrading, ensure that all upgrade processes have completed before enabling analytics.

Depending on the size and contents of the volume, enabling analytics may take time while ONTAP processes existing data in the volume. System Manager displays progress and presents analytics data when complete. If you need more precise information about initialization progress, you can use the ONTAP CLI command `volume analytics show`.

.Enable File System Analytics with the CLI
. Enable File System Analytics with the command:
`volume analytics on -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _volume_name_ [-foreground {true|false}]`
+
By default, the command runs in the foreground; ONTAP displays progress and presents analytics data when complete. If you need more precise information, you can run the command in the background by using the `-foreground false` option and then use the `volume analytics show` command to display initialization progress.
. After you finish, use ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP REST API to display the analytic data.
