To collect and display usage data such as capacity analytics, you need to enable File System Analytics on a volume.

.About this task
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can enable File System Analytics on a new or existing volume. If you upgrade a system to ONTAP 9.8 or later, ensure that all upgrade processes have completed before you enable File System Analytics.
* Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, File System Analytics is enabled by default on all newly created volumes. To modify these settings, see <<modify>>.
* Depending on the size and contents of the volume, enabling analytics may take time while ONTAP processes existing data in the volume. System Manager displays progress and presents analytics data when complete. If you need more precise information about initialization progress, you can use the ONTAP CLI command `volume analytics show`.

.Steps 

You can enable File System Analytics with System Manager or the CLI.

.To enable File System Analytics with the CLI:
. Run the following command:
`volume analytics on -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _volume_name_ [-foreground {true|false}]`
By default, the command runs in the foreground; ONTAP displays progress and presents analytics data when complete. If you need more precise information, you can run the command in the background by using the `-foreground false` option and then use the `volume analytics show` command to display initialization progress in the CLI.
. After successfully enabling File System Analytics, use System Manager or the ONTAP REST API to display the analytic data.

[[modify]]
== Modify default File System Analytics settings

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, File System Analytics is enabled by default on all newly created volumes. No additional configuration is required to maintain this setting when creating a new volume. 

Default enablement of File System Analytics consists of:

* Capacity analytics
* Activity Tracking

You can disable capacity analytics at the volume level using the <<workflow>> to enable File System Analytics. To disable Activity Tracking at the volume level, see xref:./file-system-analytics/activity-tracking-task.html[Enable Activity Tracking].

With the ONTAP CLI, you can disable File System Analytics when you create a new volume or by default at the SVM level. With System Manager, you can modify default File System Analytics settings at the cluster or storage VM level.

.System Manager
--
If you are using System Manager, you can modify the SVM configuration to disable capacity analytics and Activity Tracking at volume creation.

.Modify File System Analytics settings at the cluster level
. In System Manager, navigate to **Cluster settings**.
. In **Cluster settings**, review the settings in the File System Analytics tabs. To modify the settings, select the image:icon_gear.gif[Settings gear] icon.
. In the **Activity Tracking** field, enter the names of the storage VMs you Activity Tracking enabled for by default. Leave the field blank to disable Activity Tracking on all storage VMs.
+
Uncheck the **Enable on new storage VMs** box to disable Activity Tracking by default on new new storage VMs.
. In the **Capacity** field, enter the names of the storage VMs you want capacity analytics enabled for by default. Leave the field blank to disable capacity analytics on all storage VMs.
+
Uncheck the **Enable on new storage VMs** box to disable capacity analytics by default on new new storage VMs.
. Select **Save**.

.Modify File System Analytics settings at the SVM level
. Select the storage VM you want to modify then **Storage VM settings**.
. In the **File System Analytics** card, use the toggles to enable or disable Activity Tracking and capacity analytics for all new volumes on the storage VM.
--

.CLI
--
If you are using the ONTAP CLI, you can disable File System Analytics when you create a volume, or you can configure the storage VM to disable File System Analytics by default. 

.Disable File System Analytics on a new volume
. Create the volume with the optional `-analytics-state` and `-activity-tracking-state` parameters set to off:
+
`volume create -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -analytics-state off -activity-tracking-state off`
. Confirm the volume was created with the correct configuration:
+
`volume show -fields analytics-state,activity-tracking-state`

.Disable File System Analytics at the SVM level
. Modify the SVM to disable capacity analytics and activity tracking on all newly created volumes:
`vserver modify -vserver _svm_name_ -auto-enable-activity-tracking false -auto-enable-analytics false`
