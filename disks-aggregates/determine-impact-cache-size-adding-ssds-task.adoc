If adding SSDs to a storage pool causes your platform model's cache limit to be exceeded, ONTAP does not allocate the newly added capacity to any Flash Pool local tiers (aggregates). This can result in some or all of the newly added capacity being unavailable for use.

.About this task

When you add SSDs to an SSD storage pool that has allocation units already allocated to Flash Pool local tiers (aggregates), you increase the cache size of each of those local tiers and the total cache on the system. If none of the storage pool's allocation units have been allocated, adding SSDs to that storage pool does not affect the SSD cache size until one or more allocation units are allocated to a cache.

The procedure that you follow depends on the interface that you use--System Manager or the CLI:

.Steps

. Determine the usable size of the SSDs you are adding to the storage pool:
+
`storage disk show _disk_name_ -fields usable-size`
. Determine how many allocation units remain unallocated for the storage pool:
+
`storage pool show-available-capacity _sp_name_`
+
All unallocated allocation units in the storage pool are displayed.

. Calculate the amount of cache that will be added by applying the following formula:
+
( 4 -- number of unallocated allocation units) × 25% × usable size × number of SSDs
