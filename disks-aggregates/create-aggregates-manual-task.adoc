[.lead]
Before you create aggregates manually, you should review disk configuration options and simulate creation. Then you can issue the `storage aggregate create` and verify the results.

.What you'll need

You must have determined the number of disks and the number of hot spare disks you need in the aggregate.

.About this task

If root-data-data partitioning is enabled and you have 24 solid state drives (SSDs) or fewer in your configuration, it is recommended that your data partitions be assigned to different nodes.

The procedure for creating aggregates on systems with root-data partitioning and root-data-data partitioning enabled is the same as the procedure for creating aggregates on systems using unpartitioned disks. If root-data partitioning is enabled on your system, you should use the number of disk partitions for the `-diskcount` option. For root-data-data partitioning, the `-diskcount` option specifies the count of disks to use.

[NOTE]
====
When creating multiple aggregates for use with FlexGroups, aggregates should be as close in size as possible.
====

The `storage aggregate create` man page contains more information about aggregate creation options and requirements.

.Steps

. View the list of spare disk partitions to verify that you have enough to create your aggregate:
+
`storage aggregate show-spare-disks -original-owner _node_name_`
+
Data partitions are displayed under `Local Data Usable`. A root partition cannot be used as a spare.

. Simulate the creation of the aggregate:
+
`storage aggregate create -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -node _node_name_ -raidtype raid_dp -diskcount _number_of_disks_or_partitions_ -simulate true`
. If any warnings are displayed from the simulated command, adjust the command and repeat the simulation.
. Create the aggregate:
+
`storage aggregate create -aggregate _aggr_name_ -node _node_name_ -raidtype raid_dp -diskcount _number_of_disks_or_partitions_`
. Display the aggregate to verify that it was created:
+
`storage aggregate show-status _aggregate_name_`
