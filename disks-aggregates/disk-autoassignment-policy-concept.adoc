You can typically use the default autoassignment policy, which is equivalent to the `stack` policy for most systems, and to the `bay` policy for entry-level systems (AFF A2xx, FAS2xxx). However, for some configurations, you might need to change the autoassignment policy.

You must select the appropriate autoassignment based on your configuration:
