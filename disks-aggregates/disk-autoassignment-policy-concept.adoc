You can typically use the default auto-assignment policy, which is equivalent to the "`stack`" policy for most systems, and to the "`bay`" policy for entry-level systems (AFF A2xx, FAS2xxx). However, for some configurations, you might need to change the auto-assignment policy.

You must select the appropriate auto-assignment based on your configuration:
