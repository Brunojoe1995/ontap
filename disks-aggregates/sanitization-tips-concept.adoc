[.lead]
If you are creating or backing up aggregates to contain data that might need to be sanitized, following some simple guidelines will reduce the time it takes to sanitize your data.

* Make sure your aggregates containing sensitive data are not larger than they need to be.
+
If they are larger than needed, sanitization requires more time, disk space, and bandwidth.

* When you back up aggregates containing sensitive data, avoid backing them up to aggregates that also contain large amounts of nonsensitive data.
+
This reduces the resources required to move nonsensitive data before sanitizing sensitive data.
