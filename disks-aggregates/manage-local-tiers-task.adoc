After you learn the workflow for adding a local tier, you decide which method to use to create the local tier and how many disks and disk partitions are needed for the local tier.

+
You can use ONTAP recommendations to automatically create the local tier.

* link:add-create-local-tier-aggregate-manually-task.html[Add (create) a local tier (aggregate) manually]
+
You can choose to not accept ONTAP recommendations for creating a local tier and specify the configuration manually.
