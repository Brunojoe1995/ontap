You can manage local tier storage (aggregates) using the CLI or System Manager

After you learn the workflow for adding a local tier, you decide which method to use to create the local tier and how many disks and disk partitions are needed for the local tier.

You can perform the following tasks:

* link:add-create-local-tier-aggregate-auto-task.html[Add (create) a local tier (aggregate) automatically]
+
You can use ONTAP recommendations to automatically create the local tier.

* link:add-create-local-tier-aggregate-manually-task.html[Add (create) a local tier (aggregate) manually]
+
You can choose to not accept ONTAP recommendations for creating a local tier and specify the configuration manually.

* link:manage-local-tier-aggregate-usage.html[Manage local tier (aggregate) usage]
+
After you create local tiers, you can manage how they are used, such as renaming a local tier, assigning local tiers to storage VMs (SVMs) or reallocating local tier ownership within an HA pair.

* link:add-capacity-local-tier-aggregate-task.html[Add capacity to a local tier]
+
You can expand the local tier to include additional disks, assign disk ownership, and create a new RAID group.

* link:delete-local-tier-aggregate-task.html[Delete a local tier]
+
If you no longer need a local tier, you can delete it.
