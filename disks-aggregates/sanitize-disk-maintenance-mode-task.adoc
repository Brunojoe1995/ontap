[.lead]
Sanitizing a disk allows you to remove data from a disk or a set of disks on decommissioned or inoperable systems so that the data can never be recovered.

Two methods are available to sanitize disks:

* Using maintenance mode commands in ONTAP 9.6 and later releases.
* Using nodeshell commands in all ONTAP 9 releases.

== Maintenance mode method

Starting with ONTAP 9.6, you can perform disk sanitization in maintenance mode.

.What you'll need

* The disks cannot be self-encrypting disks (SED).
+
You must use the `storage encryption disk sanitize` command to sanitize an SED.
+
link:../encryption-at-rest/index.html[Encryption of data at rest]

.Steps

. Boot into maintenance mode.
. If the disks you want to sanitize are partitioned, unpartition each disk:
+
`disk unpartition disk_name`
. Sanitize the specified disks:
+
`disk sanitize start [-p _pattern1_|-r [-p _pattern2_|-r [-p _pattern3_|-r]]] [-c _cycle_count_] _disk_list_`
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not turn off power to the node, disrupt the storage connectivity, or remove target disks while sanitizing. If sanitizing is interrupted during the formatting phase, the formatting phase must be restarted and allowed to finish before the disks are sanitized and ready to be returned to the spare pool.     If you need to abort the sanitization process, you can do so by using the `disk sanitize abort` command. If the specified disks are undergoing the formatting phase of sanitization, the abort does not occur until the phase is complete.
====
+
`-p` `_pattern1_` `-p` `_pattern2_` `-p` `_pattern3_` specifies a cycle of one to three user-defined hex byte overwrite patterns that can be applied in succession to the disks being sanitized. The default pattern is three passes, using 0x55 for the first pass, 0xaa for the second pass, and 0x3c for the third pass.
+
`-r` replaces a patterned overwrite with a random overwrite for any or all of the passes.
+
`-c` `_cycle_count_` specifies the number of times that the specified overwrite patterns are applied. The default value is one cycle. The maximum value is seven cycles.
+
`_disk_list_` specifies a space-separated list of the IDs of the spare disks to be sanitized.

. If desired, check the status of the disk sanitization process:
+
`disk sanitize status [_disk_list_]`
. After the sanitization process is complete, return the disks to spare status for each disk:
+
`disk sanitize release _disk_name_`
. Exit maintenance mode.

== Nodeshell method

When disk sanitization is enabled using nodeshell commands, it disables some low-level ONTAP commands. After disk sanitization is enabled on a node, it cannot be disabled.

.What you'll need

* The disks must be spare disks; they must be owned by a node, but not used in an aggregate.
+
If the disks are partitioned, neither partition can be in use in an aggregate.

* The disks cannot be self-encrypting disks (SED).
+
You must use the `storage encryption disk sanitize` command to sanitize an SED.
+
link:../encryption-at-rest/index.html[Encryption of data at rest]

* The disks cannot be part of a storage pool.

.Steps

. Enter the nodeshell for the node that owns the disks you want to sanitize:
+
`system node run -node node_name`

. Enable disk sanitization:
+
`options licensed_feature.disk_sanitization.enable on`
+
You are asked to confirm the command because it is irreversible.

. If the disks you want to sanitize are partitioned, unpartition each disk:
+
`disk unpartition disk_name`

. Sanitize the specified disks:
+
`disk sanitize start [-p pattern1|-r [-p pattern2|-r [-p pattern3|-r]]] [-c cycle_count] disk_list`
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not turn off power to the node, disrupt the storage connectivity, or remove target
disks while sanitizing. If sanitizing is interrupted during the formatting phase, the formatting
phase must be restarted and allowed to finish before the disks are sanitized and ready to be
returned to the spare pool.

If you need to abort the sanitization process, you can do so by using the disk sanitize
abort command. If the specified disks are undergoing the formatting phase of sanitization, the
abort does not occur until the phase is complete.

`-p pattern1 -p pattern2 -p pattern3` specifies a cycle of one to three user-defined hex byte
overwrite patterns that can be applied in succession to the disks being sanitized. The default
pattern is three passes, using 0x55 for the first pass, 0xaa for the second pass, and 0x3c for the
third pass.
+
`-r` replaces a patterned overwrite with a random overwrite for any or all of the passes.
+
``-c cycle_count` specifies the number of times that the specified overwrite patterns are applied.
+
The default value is one cycle. The maximum value is seven cycles.
+
`disk_list` specifies a space-separated list of the IDs of the spare disks to be sanitized.

. If you want to check the status of the disk sanitization process:
+
`disk sanitize status [disk_list]`

. After the sanitization process is complete, return the disks to spare status:
+
`disk sanitize release disk_name`

. Return to the clustered Data ONTAP CLI:
+
`exit`

. Determine whether all of the disks were returned to spare status:
+
`storage aggregate show-spare-disks`

h| If...
h| Then...

| All of the sanitized disks are listed as spares
| You are done. The disks are sanitized and in spare status.

| Some of the sanitized disks are not listed as spares
a| Complete the following steps:

.. Enter advanced privilege mode:
+
`set -privilege advanced`

.. Assign the unassigned sanitized disks to the appropriate node for each disk:
+
`storage disk assign -disk disk_name -owner node_name`

.. Return the disks to spare status for each disk:
+
`storage disk unfail -disk disk_name -s -q`

.. Return to administrative mode:
+`set -privilege admin`
|===

.Result
The specified disks are sanitized and designated as hot spares. The serial numbers of the sanitized disks are written to `/etc/log/sanitized_disks`.
