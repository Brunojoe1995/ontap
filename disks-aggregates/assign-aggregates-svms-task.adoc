If you assign one or more aggregates to a storage virtual machine (SVM, formerly known as Vserver), then you can use only those aggregates to contain volumes for that SVM. Assigning aggregates to your SVMs is particularly important in a multi-tenancy environment.

.What you'll need

The SVM and the aggregates you want to assign to that SVM must already exist.

.About this task

Assigning aggregates to your SVMs helps you keep your SVMs isolated from each other; this is especially important in a multi-tenancy environment..

.Steps

. Check the list of aggregates already assigned to the SVM:
+
`vserver show -fields aggr-list`
+
The aggregates currently assigned to the SVM are displayed. If there are no aggregates assigned, "`-`" is displayed.

. Add or remove assigned aggregates, depending on your requirements:
+

|===

h| If you want to... h| Use this command...

a|
Assign additional aggregates
a|
`vserver add-aggregates`
a|
Unassign aggregates
a|
`vserver remove-aggregates`
|===
The listed aggregates are assigned to or removed from the SVM. If the SVM already has volumes that use an aggregate that is not assigned to the SVM, a warning message is displayed, but the command is completed successfully. Any aggregates that were already assigned to the SVM and that were not named in the command are unaffected.

.Example

In the following example, the aggregates aggr1 and aggr2 are assigned to SVM svm1:

`vserver add-aggregates -vserver svm1 -aggregates aggr1,aggr2`
