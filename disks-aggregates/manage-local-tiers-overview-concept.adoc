You can add local tiers (aggregates), manage their usage, and add capacity (disks) to them using System Manager or the CLI.

You can perform the following tasks:

== Prepare to add a local tier (aggregate)

Before you add a local tier, you can learn about RAID groups and RAID protection levels and policies for local tiers:

* link:../concepts/aggregates-raid-groups-concept.html[Local tiers (aggregates) and RAID groups]
* link:raid-protection-levels-disks-concept.html[RAID protection levels for disks]
* link:default-raid-policies-aggreages-concept.html[Default RAID policies for local tiers (aggregates)]

You can learn about mirrored and unmirrored local tiers and how to quickly zero drives before provisioning them.  You also perform a manual assignment of disk ownership before provisioning a local tier.

* link:mirrored-unmirrored-aggregates-concept.html[Mirrored and unmirrored local tiers (aggregates)]
* link:fast-zeroing-drives-concept.html[Fast zeroing of drives]
* link:manual-assign-disks-ownership-task.html[Manually asign disk ownership]


== Add (create) a local tier (aggregate)

To add a local tier, you follow a specific workflow.  You determine the number of disks or disk partitions that you need for the local tier and decide which method to use to create the local tier.   You can add local tiers automatically by letting ONTAP assign the configuration, or you can manually specify the configuration.

* link:aggregate-expansion-workflow-concept.html[Workflow to add a local tier (aggregate)]
* link:determine-number-disks-partitions-aggregate-concept.html[Determine the number of disks or disk partitions required for a local tier (aggregate)]
* link:decide-aggregate-creation-method-concept.html[Decide which local tier (aggregate) creation method to use ]
* link:create-aggregates-auto-provision-task.html[Add local tiers (aggregates) automatically]
* link:create-aggregates-manual-task.html[Add local tiers (aggregates) manually]

== Manage the usage of local tiers (aggregates)

For existing local tiers, you can rename them, set their media costs, or determine their drive and RAID group information.

* link:rename-local-tier-aggregate-task.html[Rename a local tier (aggregate)]
* link:set-media-cost-local-tier-aggregate-task.html[Set the media cost of a local tier (aggregate)]
* link:determine-drive-raid-group-info-aggregate-task.html[Determine drive and RAID group information for a local tier (aggregate)]

You can modify the RAID configuration of a local tier and assign local tiers to storage VMs (SVMs).

* link:modify-raid-config-local-tier-aggregate-task.html[Modify the RAID configuration of a local tier (aggregate)]
* link:assign-aggregates-svms-task.html[Assign local tiers (aggregates) to storage VMs (SVMs)]

You can determine which volumes reside on a local tier and how much space they use on a local tier. You can control how much space that volumes can use.

* link:determine-volumes-reside-aggregate-task.html[Determine which volumes reside on a local tier (aggregate)]
* link:determine-control-volume-space-aggregate-concept.html[Determine and control a volume's space usage in a local tier(aggregate)]
* link:determine-space-usage-aggregate-concept.html[Determine space usage in a local tier (aggregate)]

You can relocate local tier ownership with an HA pair.  You can also delete a local tier.

* link:relocate-aggregate-ownership-task.html[Relocate local tier (aggregate) ownership within an HA pair]
* link:delete-local-tier-aggregate-task.html[Delete a local tier (aggregate)]

== Add capacity (disks) to a local tier (aggregate)

Using different methods, you follow a specific workflow to add capacity.

link:add-capacity-disks-local-tier-aggregate-overview-concept.html[Overview of adding capacity (disks) to a local tier (aggregate)]
link:aggregate-expansion-workflow-concept.html[Workflow to add capacity to a local tier (aggregate)]

You can add disks to a local tier, add drives to a node or shelf, add disks to a new RAID-group, and add disks with multiple RAID-group options.   If needed, you can correct misaligned spare partitions.

link:add-disks-node-task.html[Add drives to a node or shelf]
link:add-disks-to-new-raid-group-task.html[Add disks to a new RAID-group]
