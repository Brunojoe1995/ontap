[.lead]
You can manage ONTAP physical storage using the CLI. You can create, expand, and manage aggregates, work with Flash Pool aggregates, manage disks, and manage RAID policies.

You perform these tasks if the following are true:

* You want to use the command-line interface (CLI), not System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You have a MetroCluster configuration and you are following the procedures in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster[MetroCluster^] documentation for initial configuration and guidelines for aggregates and disk management.
