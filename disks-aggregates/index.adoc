You can manage ONTAP physical storage using the CLI or System Manager. You can create, expand, and manage local tiers (aggregates), work with Flash Pool aggregates, manage disks, and manage RAID configurations and policies.

You perform these tasks if the following are true:

* You do not want to use an automated scripting tool.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You have a MetroCluster configuration and you are following the procedures in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster[MetroCluster^] documentation for initial configuration and guidelines for local tiers (aggregates) and disk management.
