For root-data partitioning, there are three owned entities (the container disk and the two partitions) collectively owned by the HA pair.

The container disk and the two partitions do not all need to be owned by the same node in the HA pair as long as they are all owned by one of the nodes in the HA pair. However, when you use a partition in a local tier (aggregate), it must be owned by the same node that owns the local tier.

.Steps

. Use the CLI to display the current ownership for the partitioned disk:
+
`storage disk show -disk _disk_name_ -partition-ownership`
. Set the CLI privilege level to advanced:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Enter the appropriate command, depending on which ownership entity you want to assign ownership for:

Container disk

`storage disk assign -disk _disk_name_ -owner _owner_name_`

Data partition

`storage disk assign -disk _disk_name_ -owner _owner_name_ -data true`

Root partition

`storage disk assign -disk _disk_name_ -owner _owner_name_ -root true`

If any of the ownership entities are already owned, then you must include the "`-force`" option.
