Ethernet networks vary greatly in performance. You can maximize the performance of the network used for iSCSI by selecting specific configuration values.

.Steps

. Connect the host and storage ports to the same network.
+
It is best to connect to the same switches. Routing should never be used.

. Select the highest speed ports available, and dedicate them to iSCSI.
+
10 GbE ports are best. 1 GbE ports are the minimum.

. Disable Ethernet flow control for all ports.
+
You should see link:../networking/networking_reference.html[Network management] for using the CLI to configure Ethernet port flow control.

. Enable jumbo frames (typically MTU of 9000).
+
All devices in the data path, including initiators, targets, and switches, must support jumbo frames. Otherwise, enabling jumbo frames actually reduces network performance substantially.
