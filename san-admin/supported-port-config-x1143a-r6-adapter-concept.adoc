The FC target mode is the default configuration for X1143A-R6 adapter ports. However, ports on this adapter can be configured as either 10-Gb Ethernet and FCoE ports or as 16-Gb FC ports.

When configured for Ethernet and FCoE, X1143A-R6 adapters support concurrent NIC and FCoE target traffic on the same 10-GBE port. When configured for FC, each two-port pair that shares the same ASIC can be individually configured for FC target or FC initiator mode. This means that a single X1143A-R6 adapter can support FC target mode on one two-port pair and FC initiator mode on another two-port pair.
