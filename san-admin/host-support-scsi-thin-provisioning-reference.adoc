To leverage the benefits of SCSI thin provisioning, it must be supported by your host. SCSI thin provisioning uses the Logical Block Provisioning feature as defined in the SCSI SBC-3 standard. Only hosts that support this standard can use SCSI thin provisioning in ONTAP.

The following hosts currently support SCSI thin provisioning when you enable space allocation:

* Citrix XenServer 6.5 & later
* ESXi 5.0 & later
* RHEL 6.2 & later
* SLES11 & later
* Solaris 11.1 & later
* Windows 2012 & later

When you enable the space allocation functionality in ONTAP, you turn on the following SCSI thin provisioning features:

* Unmapping and reporting space usage for space reclamation
* Reporting resource exhaustion errors
