Microsoft Offloaded Data Transfer (ODX), also known as _copy offload_, enables direct data transfers within a storage device or between compatible storage devices without transferring the data through the host computer.

ONTAP supports ODX for both the SMB and SAN protocols.

In non-ODX file transfers, the data is read from the source and is transferred across the network to the host. The host transfers the data back over the network to the destination. In ODX file transfer, the data is copied directly from the source to the destination without passing through the host.

Because ODX offloaded copies are performed directly between the source and destination, significant performance benefits are realized, including faster copy time, reduced utilization of CPU and memory on the client, and reduced network I/O bandwidth utilization.

For SAN environments, ODX is only available when it is supported by both the host and the storage system. Client computers that support ODX and have ODX enabled automatically and transparently use offloaded file transfer when moving or copying files. ODX is used regardless of whether you drag-and-drop files through Windows Explorer or use command-line file copy commands, or whether a client application initiates file copy requests.
