[.lead]
Use the following procedures to perform basic SAN host provisioning. You can configure and manage LUNs, igroups, and targets using the iSCSI and FC protocols, and namespaces and subsystems using the NVMe/FC protocol.

You should use these procedures under the following circumstances:

* You want to understand the range of ONTAP SAN host provisioning capabilities.
* You want to perform less common configuration and maintenance tasks, not basic SAN configuration.
* You want to use the command-line interface (CLI), not System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
