[.lead]
If you configure a FlexVol volume to automatically delete FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs, any clone that fits the criteria you specify might be deleted. If you have specific FlexClone files or FlexClone LUNs that you want to preserve, you can exclude them from the automatic FlexClone deletion process.

.What you'll need

A FlexClone license must be installed. This license is included with link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html#licenses-included-with-ontap-one[ONTAP One].

.About this task

When you create a FlexClone file or FlexClone LUN, by default the autodelete setting for the clone is disabled. FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs with autodelete disabled are preserved when you configure a FlexVol volume to automatically delete clones to reclaim space on the volume.

[NOTE]
====
If you set the `commitment` level on the volume to `try` or `disrupt`, you can individually preserve specific FlexClone files or FlexClone LUNs by disabling autodelete for those clones. However, if you set the `commitment` level on the volume to `destroy` and the destroy lists include `lun_clone,file_clone`, the volume setting overrides the clone setting, and all FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs can be deleted regardless of the autodelete setting for the clones.
====

.Steps

. Prevent a specific FlexClone file or FlexClone LUN from being automatically deleted by using the `volume file clone autodelete` command.
+
The following example shows how you can disable autodelete for FlexClone LUN lun1_clone contained in vol1:
+
----
cluster1::> volume file clone autodelete -vserver vs1 -volume vol1 -clone-path lun1_clone -enable false
----
+
A FlexClone file or FlexClone LUN with autodelete disabled cannot be deleted automatically to reclaim space on the volume.

. Verify that autodelete is disabled for the FlexClone file or FlexClone LUN by using the `volume file clone show-autodelete` command.
+
The following example shows that autodelete is false for the FlexClone LUN lun1_clone:
+
----
cluster1::> volume file clone show-autodelete -vserver vs1 -clone-path vol/vol1/lun1_clone
															Vserver Name: vs1
															Clone Path: vol/vol1/lun1_clone
															Autodelete Enabled: false
