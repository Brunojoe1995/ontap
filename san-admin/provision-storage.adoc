If a procedure for your specific host is not available, you can use these steps to provision storage for any host.  

This procedure creates new LUNs on an existing storage VM which already has the FC or iSCSI protocol configured.

If you need to create a new storage VM and configure the FC or iSCSI protocol, see link:configure-svm-fc-task.html[Configure an SVM for FC] or link:configure-svm-iscsi-task.html[Configure an SVM for iSCSI].

If the FC license is not enabled, the LIFs and SVMs appear to be online but the operational status is down. 

LUNs appear to your host as disk devices.

NOTE: Asymmetric logical unit access (ALUA) is always enabled during LUN creation. You cannot change the ALUA setting.

You must use single initiator zoning for all of the FC LIFs in the SVM to host the initiators.

====
.System Manager

Create LUNs to provide storage for a SAN host using the FC or iSCSI protocol with ONTAP System Manager (9.7 and later).

To complete this task using System Manager Classic (available with 9.7 and earlier) refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/iscsi-config-rhel/index.html[iSCSI configuration for Red Hat Enterprise Linux^]

.Steps

. Install the appropriate link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sanhost/[SAN host utilities] on your host.

. In System Manager, click *Storage > LUNs* and then click *Add*.

. Enter the required information to create the LUN.

. For FC, zone your FC switches by WWPN. Use one zone per initiator and include all target ports in each zone.

. Discover LUNs on your host.

. Verify that the host can write and read data on the LUN.
