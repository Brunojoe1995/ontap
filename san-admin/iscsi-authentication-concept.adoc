[.lead]
During the initial stage of an iSCSI session, the initiator sends a login request to the storage system to begin an iSCSI session. The storage system then either permits or denies the login request, or determine that a login is not required.

iSCSI authentication methods are:

* Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)--The initiator logs in using a CHAP user name and password.
+
You can specify a CHAP password or generate a hexadecimal secret password. There are two types of CHAP user names and passwords:

 ** Inbound--The storage system authenticates the initiator.
+
Inbound settings are required if you are using CHAP authentication.

 ** Outbound--This is an optional setting to enable the initiator to authenticate the storage system.
+
You can use outbound settings only if you define an inbound user name and password on the storage system.

* deny--The initiator is denied access to the storage system.
* none--The storage system does not require authentication for the initiator.

You can define the list of initiators and their authentication methods. You can also define a default authentication method that applies to initiators that are not on this list.
