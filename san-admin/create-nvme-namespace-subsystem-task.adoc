summary: "For systems using the NVMe protocol, you must create one or more NVMe namespaces and subsystems. Each namespace can then be mapped to an NVMe subsystem to allow data access from your host system."

[.lead]
If a procedure for your specific host is not available, you can use these steps to create namespaces and provision storage for any NVMe supported host.

Namespaces appear to Linux as SCSI disk devices.

This procedure creates new namespaces on an existing storage VM. Your storage VM must be configured for NVME, and your FC or TCP transport should already be set up.

.Steps

// start tabbed area

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager
--

Create namespaces to provide storage using the NVMe protocol with ONTAP System Manager (9.7 and later).

. In System Manager, click *Storage > NVMe Namespaces* and then click *Add*.
+
If you need to create a new subsystem, click *More Options*.

[start=2]
. Zone your FC switches by WWPN. Use one zone per initiator and include all target ports in each zone.

. On your host, discover the new namespaces.

. Initialize the namespace and format it with a file system.

. Verify that your host can write and read data on the namespace.

.CLI
--
Create namespaces to provide storage using the NVMe protocol with the ONTAP CLI.

This procedure creates an NVMe namespace and subsystem on an existing storage VM which has already been configured for the NVMe protocol, then maps the namespace to the subsystem to allow data access from your host system.

If you need to configure the storage VM for NVMe, see link:configure-svm-nvme-task.html[Configure an SVM for NVMe].

== About NVMe subsystems

An NVMe subsystem includes one or more controllers, one or more namespaces, one or more non-volatile memory (NVM) subsystem ports (FC-NVMe or RDMA transport ports), an NVM storage medium, and an interface between the controllers and the NVM storage medium. For controller mapping and management, an NVM subsystem maps to a vserver in ONTAP.

An NVMe over Fabric (NVMeoF) subsystem is a separate kernel object that resides in the FreeBSD kernel. The NVMeoF subsystem interfaces with the following components:

* SAN components, such as BCOMKA, FCT, and VDOM
* WAFL
* RAS components, such as CM, ASUP, and EMS

All interfaces with NVMeoF subsystems adhere to the current definitions and patterns found in ONTAP.
