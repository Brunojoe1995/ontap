summary: "For systems using the NVMe protocol, you must create one or more NVMe namespaces and subsystems. Each namespace can then be mapped to an NVMe subsystem to allow data access from your host system."

== About NVMe subsystems

An NVMe subsystem includes one or more controllers, one or more namespaces, one or more non-volatile memory (NVM) subsystem ports (FC-NVMe or RDMA transport ports), an NVM storage medium, and an interface between the controllers and the NVM storage medium. For controller mapping and management, an NVM subsystem maps to a vserver in ONTAP.

An NVMe over Fabric (NVMeoF) subsystem is a separate kernel object that resides in the FreeBSD kernel. The NVMeoF subsystem interfaces with the following components:

* SAN components, such as BCOMKA, FCT, and VDOM
* WAFL
* RAS components, such as CM, ASUP, and EMS

All interfaces with NVMeoF subsystems adhere to the current definitions and patterns found in ONTAP.
