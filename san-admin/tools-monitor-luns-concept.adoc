Tools are available to help you effectively monitor your LUNs and avoid running out of space.

* Active IQ Unified Manager is a free tool that enables you to manage all storage across all clusters in your environment.
* System Manager is a graphical user interface built into ONTAP that enables you to manually manage storage needs at the cluster level.
* OnCommand Insight presents a single view of your storage infrastructure and enables you to set up automatic monitoring, alerts, and reporting when your LUNs, volumes, and aggregates are running out of storage space.
