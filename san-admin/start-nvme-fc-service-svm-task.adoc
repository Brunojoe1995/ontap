Before you can use the NVMe protocol on your storage virtual machine (SVM), you must start the NVMe service on the SVM.

.What you'll need

NVMe must be allowed as a protocol on your system.

The following NVMe protocols are supported:

|===

h| Protocol h| Beginning with... h| Allowed by...

| TCP
| ONTAP 9.10.1
| Default

| FCP
| ONTAP 9.4
| Default
|===

.Steps

. Change the privilege setting to advanced:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Verify that NVMe is allowed as a protocol:
+
`vserver nvme show`
. Create the NVMe protocol service:
+
`vserver nvme create`
. Start the NVMe protocol service on the SVM:
+
`vserver nvme modify -status -admin up`
