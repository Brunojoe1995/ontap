This procedure creates new LUNs on an existing storage VM which already has the FC or iSCSI protocol configured.

If you need to create a new storage VM and configure the FC or iSCSI protocol, see link:san-admin/configure-svm-fc-task.html[Configure an SVM for FC] or link:san-admin/configure-svm-iscsi-task.html[Configure an SVM for iSCSI].

LUNs appear to Linux as SCSI disk devices.

NOTE: Asymmetric logical unit access (ALUA) is always enabled during LUN creation. You cannot change the ALUA setting.

You must have an FC license and it must be enabled. If the FC license is not enabled, the LIFs and SVMs appear to be online but the operational status is down. The FC service must be enabled for your LIFs and SVMs to be operational. You must use single initiator zoning for all of the FC LIFs in the SVM to host the initiators.

You need to know the initiator identifiers (FC WWPN or iSCSI iqn) for your Linux server.

// start tabbed area

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager
--

Create LUNs to provide storage for a Linux server using the FC or iSCSI SAN protocol with ONTAP System Manager (9.7 and later).

To complete this task using System Manager Classic (available with 9.7 and earlier) refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/iscsi-config-rhel/index.html[iSCSI configuration for Red Hat Enterprise Linux^]


. On your Linux server, install the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sanhost/hu_luhu_71.html#installing-linux-unified-host-utilities[NetApp Linux Host Utilities] package.

. In System Manager, click *Storage > LUNs* and then click *Add*.

. Enter the required information to create the LUN.
+
include::_include/san_add_lun_more_options.adoc[]

[start=5]
. For FC, zone your FC switches by WWPN. Use one zone per initiator and include all target ports in each zone.

. On your Linux server, discover the new LUNs:
+
`/usr/bin/rescan-scsi-bus.sh`
+
NOTE: Optionally partition the LUNs and create file systems.

. Verify the Linux server can write and read data on the LUN.
