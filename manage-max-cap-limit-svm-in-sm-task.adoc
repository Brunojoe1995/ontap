Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can enable a maximum capacity limit for a storage VM and set a threshold to trigger alerts when the used storage reaches a certain percentage of the maximum capacity.

.About this task

The following chart explains how the measurement of the capacity across volumes relates to the maximum capacity limit.

== Enable a maximum capacity limit for a storage VM

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can specify the maximum capacity that can be allocated for all volumes in a storage VM.  You can enable the maximum capacity when you add a storage VM or when you edit an existing storage VM.

.Steps

. Select *Storage* > *Storage VMs*.

. Perform one of the following:

** To edit a storage VM, click image:icon_kabob.gif[kebab icon] next to the name of the storage VM, and then click *Edit*. 
--

. Enter or modify the settings for the storage VM, and select the check box labeled "Enable maximum capacity limit".

. Specify the maximum capacity size.

. Specify the percentage of the maximum capacity you want to use as a threshold to trigger alerts.

. Click *Save*.

[[edit-max-cap-limit-svm]]

== Edit the maximum capacity limit of a storage VM

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can edit the maximum capacity limit of an existing storage VM, if the <<enable-max-cap,maximum capacity limit has been enabled>> already.
 
.Steps

. Select *Storage* > *Storage VMs*.

. Click image:icon_kabob.gif[kebab icon] next to the name of the storage VM, and then click *Edit*.
+ 
The check box labelled "Enable maximum capacity limit" is already checked.
. Specify the new maximum capacity size.
. Specify the new percentage of the maximum capacity you want to use as a threshold to trigger alerts.
. Click *Save*.
