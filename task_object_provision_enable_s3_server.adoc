[.lead]
Add an S3 server to a new or existing storage VM for serving content to S3 clients.

An S3 server can coexist in a storage VM with other protocol servers, or you can create a new storage VM to isolate the namespace and workload.

.Before you begin
You should be prepared to enter an S3 server name (FQDN) and IP addresses for interface role Data.

If you are using an external-CA signed certificate, you will be prompted to enter it during this procedure; you also have the option to use a system-generated certificate.

.Steps
.	Enable S3 on a storage VM.
..	Add a new storage VM: click *Storage > Storage VMs*, then click *Add*.
+
If this is a new system with no existing storage VMs: click *Dashboard > Configure Protocols*.
+
If you are adding an S3 server to an existing storage VM: click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select a storage VM, click *Settings*, and then click image:icon_gear.gif[settings icon] under *S3*.

..	Click *Enable S3*, then enter the S3 Server Name.
+
This will be the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that clients will use.

..	Select the certificate type.
+
Whether you select system-generated certificate or one of your own, it will be required for client access.

..	Enter the network interfaces.

.	If you selected the system-generated certificate, you see the certificate information when the new storage VM creation is confirmed. Click *Download* and save it for client access.
+
* The secret key will not be displayed again.
* If you need the certificate information again: click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, and click *Settings*.
