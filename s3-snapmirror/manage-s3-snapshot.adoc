With the S3 Snapshot feature, you have the option to manually generate snapshots or set up snapshot policies to automatically create them. Snapshots serve as static copies of objects that you use for data backup and recovery. For determining the tenure of snapshot retention, you can create snapshot policies that facilitate automatic snapshot creation at specified intervals.

You can manually create a Snapshot copy by using the ONTAP CLI. The procedure creates a Snapshot copy on the local cluster only.

----
vserver object-store-server bucket snapshot create -vserver <vserner-name> -bucket <bucket-name> -snapshot <snapshot-name>
