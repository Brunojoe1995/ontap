Beginning with 9.16.1, you can use S3 Snapshot technology to generate point-in-time backup of your ONTAP S3 buckets. By creating Snapshot copies of your buckets, you can eliminate the need for full and continuous bucket replication. 

For information about volume snapshots in ONTAP, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/concepts/snapshot-copies-concept.html[Snapshot copies^]. 

The S3 Snapshot feature leverages bucket versioning to track the objects captured in a bucket snapshot. Snapshot copies of S3 buckets do not contain object version history and should be governed by snapshot policies to manage the retention tenure of snapshots. The default snapshot policy preserves: 

* Six hourly snapshots
* Two daily snapshots
* Two weekly snapshots

Object versioning history and point-in-time tags will be included in a future release.

Using the S3 Snapshot feature, you can manually create snapshots or automatically generate them through snapshot policies. Additionally, you can browse snapshots to determine errors, restore a bucket, and delete snapshots to free up space.
