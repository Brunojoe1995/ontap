If data in a source bucket is lost or corrupted, you repopulate your data by restoring from a destination bucket.

.About this task

You can restore the destination bucket to an existing bucket or a new bucket. The target bucket for the restore operation must be larger than the destination bucket’s logical used space.

If you use an existing bucket, it must be empty when starting a restore operation.  Restore does not "roll back" a bucket in time; rather, it populates an empty bucket with its previous contents.

The restore operation must be initiated from the remote cluster.

== System Manager procedure

Restore the back-up data:

. Click *Protection > Relationships*, then select *S3 SnapMirror*.
. Click image:icon_kabob.gif[more icon] and then select *Restore*.
. Under *Source*, select *Existing Bucket* (the default) or *New Bucket*.
* To restore to an *Existing Bucket* (the default), complete these actions:
** Select the cluster and storage VM to search for the existing bucket.
** Select the existing bucket.
** Copy and paste the contents of the _destination_ S3 server CA certificate.
* To restore to a *New Bucket*, enter the following values:
** The cluster and storage VM to host the new bucket.
** The new bucket’s name, capacity, and performance service level.
See link:../s3-config/storage-service-definitions-reference.html[Storage service levels] for more information.
** The contents of the _destination_ S3 server CA certificate.
. Under *Destination*, copy and paste the contents of the _source_ S3 server CA certificate.
. Click *Protection > Relationships* to monitor the restore progress.

== CLI procedure

. If you are restoring to a new bucket, create the new bucket. For more information, see link:create-cloud-backup-new-bucket-task.html[Create a backup relationship for a new bucket (cloud target)].
. Initiate a restore operation for the destination bucket:
`snapmirror restore -source-path _svm_name_:/bucket/_bucket_name_  -destination-path _svm_name_:/bucket/_bucket_name_`
