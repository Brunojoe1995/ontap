//Question: Is it necessary to create a new export policy for the root volume, or should we modify the default policy?

.Before you begin
Ensure that you have noted the configuration details for any networking, authentication, or security services required in your environment.

.Steps

. Enable NFS on a storage VM.

* For new storage VMs: Click *Storage > Storage VMs*, click *Add*, enter a storage VM name, and in the *SMB/CIFS, NFS, S3* tab, select *Enable NFS*.

... Confirm the default language.
... Add network interfaces.
... Update storage VM administrator account information (optional).

* For existing storage VMs: click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select a storage VM, click *Settings*, and then click image:icon_gear.gif[settings icon] under *NFS*.

. Open the export policy of the storage VM root volume:

.. Click *Storage > Volumes*, select the root volume of the storage VM (which by default is _volume-name_ _root), and then click on the policy that is displayed under *Export Policy*.

.. Click *Add* to add a rule.

*** Client specification = `0.0.0.0/0`

*** Access protocols = NFS

*** Access details = UNIX Read-Only

. Configure DNS for host-name resolution: click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, click *Settings*, and then click image:icon_gear.gif[settings icon] under *DNS*.

. Configure name services as required.

.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, click *Settings*, and then click for image:icon_gear.gif[settings icon] LDAP or NIS.

.. Click image:icon_pencil.gif[edit icon] in the Name Services Switch tile to include any changes.

. Configure encryption if required:
