You can quickly install and configure Active IQ Unified Manager (formerly OnCommand Unified Manager), perform basic monitoring tasks, and identify performance issues.

You should use these procedure to monitor cluster performance, if the following assumptions apply to your situation:

* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You want to install Unified Manager by using a virtual appliance, instead of a Linux or Windows-based installation.
* You're willing to use a static configuration rather than DHCP to install the software.
* You are a cluster administrator with the "admin" role.
