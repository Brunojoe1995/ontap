For any ONTAP system that sends AutoSupport telemetry to NetApp, you can view extensive performance and capacity data.Active IQ shows system performance over a longer period than you can see in System Manager.

You can view graphs of CPU utilization, latency, IOPS, IOPS by protocol, and network throughput. You can also download this data in .csv format for analysis in other tools.

In addition to this performance data, Active IQ can show you storage efficiency by workload and compare that efficiency to the expected efficiency for that type of workload. You can view capacity trends and see an estimate of how much additional storage you might need to add in a given timeframe

[NOTE]
====

* Storage Efficiency is available at the customer, cluster, and node level on the left-hand-side of the main dashboard.
* Performance is available at the cluster and node level on the left-hand-side of the main dashboard.
