Some ONTAP features are enabled by license keys. You can add license keys using System Manager.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you use System Manager to install a NetApp License File to enable multiple licensed features all at once. Using a NetApp License File simplifies license installation because you no longer have to add separate feature license keys. You download the NetApp License File from the NetApp Support Site.

If you already have license keys for some features and you are upgrading to ONTAP 9.10.1, you can continue to use those license keys.

.Steps

. Click *Cluster > Settings*.
. Under *Licenses*, click image:icon_arrow.gif[arrow icon].
. Click *Browse* to locate and select the NetApp License File you downloaded.
. If you have license keys you want to add, select *Use 28-character license keys* and enter the keys.
