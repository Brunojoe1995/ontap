.Back up locked buckets

Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can back up locked S3 buckets and restore them as required. 

When defining the protection settings for a new or existing bucket, you can enable object locking on destination buckets, provided that the source and destination clusters run ONTAP 9.14.1 or later, and that object locking is enabled on the source bucket. The object locking mode and lock retention tenure of the source bucket become applicable for the replicated objects on the destination bucket. You can also define a different lock retention period for the destination bucket in the *Destination Settings* section. This retention period is also applied to any non-locked objects replicated from the source bucket and S3 interfaces.

For information about how to enable object locking on a bucket, see link:../s3-config/create-bucket-task.html[Create a bucket].
