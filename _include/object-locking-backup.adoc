.Back up locked buckets
##added this section##
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can back up locked buckets and restore them as required. 

When defining the protection settings for a new or existing bucket, you can enable object locking on destination buckets, provided, the source and destination clusters run ONTAP 9.14.1 or later, and object-locking is enabled on the source bucket. The retention mode and lock retention tenure of the source bucket are applied on the locked objects replicated from the source to the destination. You can also define a different lock retention period for the destination bucket in the *Destination Settings* section. This retention period is applied to the non-locked objects replicated from the source bucket and S3 interfaces.

For information about object locking, see link:../s3-config/create-bucket-task.html[Create a bucket].
