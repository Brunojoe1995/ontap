.Restore locked buckets
##added this section##
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can back up locked buckets and restore them as required. 

You can restore an object-locked bucket to a new or existing bucket. During restore, select an object-locked bucket as the destination in the following scenarios:

* *Restore to a new bucket*: A bucket with object locking enabled can be restored by creating an object locking-enabled bucket. On restore, the retention mode and tenure of the original bucket are replicated. You can also define a different lock retention period for the new bucket. This retention period is applied to the non-locked objects restored from other sources.
* *Restore to an existing bucket*: Object locked buckets can be restored to existing buckets, only if object locking and versioning are enabled on that bucket.
*Restore non-locked bucket*: A non-locked bucket can be restored by creating an object locking-enabled bucket on the source cluster. On restore, all the non-locked objects are locked, and the retention mode and tenure of the destination bucket become applicable for them.
