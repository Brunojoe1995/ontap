.Restore locked buckets
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can back up locked buckets and restore them as needed. 

You can restore an object-locked bucket to a new or existing bucket. You can select an object-locked bucket as the destination in the following scenarios:

* *Restore to a new bucket*: When object locking is enabled, a bucket can be restored by creating a bucket that also has object locking enabled. When you  restore a locked bucket, the object locking mode and retention period of the original bucket are replicated. You can also define a different lock retention period for the new bucket. This retention period is applied to non-locked objects from other sources.
* *Restore to an existing bucket*: An object-locked bucket can be restored to an existing bucket, as long as versioning and a similar object-locking mode are enabled on the existing bucket. The retention tenure of the original bucket is maintained.
* *Restore non-locked bucket*: Even if object locking is not enabled on a bucket, you can restore it to a bucket that has object locking enabled and is on the source cluster. When you restore the bucket, all the non-locked objects become locked, and the retention mode and tenure of the destination bucket become applicable for them.
