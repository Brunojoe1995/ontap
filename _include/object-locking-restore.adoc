.Restore locked objects
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, back up locked objects and restore them as required. 

You can restore locked object from a protected bucket to a new or existing bucket. Note these points:

* Objects from a bucket with object locking enabled can be restored by creating a new bucket and enabling object locking for that bucket. In this case, the retention mode and tenure of the restored objects is replicated. You can also define a different lock retention period for the destination bucket. This retention period is applied to the non-locked objects replicated from the source bucket and S3 interfaces.
