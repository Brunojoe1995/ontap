You should be aware of the following regarding the size of your LUNs.

* When you create a LUN , the actual size of the LUN might vary slightly based on the OS type of the LUN. The LUN OS type cannot be modified after the LUN is created.
* The metadata for each LUN requires approximately 64 KB of space in the containing aggregate. When you create a LUN, you must ensure that the containing aggregate has enough space for the LUN's metadata. If the aggregate does not contain enough space for the LUN's metadata, some hosts might not be able to access the LUN.
* If you create a LUN at the max 16 TB size, be aware that the actual size of the LUN might be slightly less. ONTAP rounds down the limit to be slightly less.
* *AMANDA'S NOTE - MOVE THIS* This can go so in task to resize lun:  In ONTAP 9.4 and earlier, if necessary, you can grow your LUN up to 10 times its original size. For example, if you create a 100 GB LUN, you can grow that LUN to 1,000 GB. You cannot exceed 16 TB, which is the maximum LUN size. This limitation does not apply to ONTAP 9.5 and later.*
