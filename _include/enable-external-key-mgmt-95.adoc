You can use one or more KMIP servers to secure the keys the cluster uses to access encrypted data. You can connect up to four KMIP servers to a node. A minimum of two servers is recommended for redundancy and disaster recovery.

.What you'll need

* The KMIP SSL client and server certificates must have been installed.
* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.
* You must configure the MetroCluster environment before you configure an external key manager.
* In a MetroCluster environment, you must install the KMIP Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate on both clusters.

.About this task

ONTAP configures KMIP server connectivity for all nodes in the cluster.

.Steps

. Configure key manager connectivity for cluster nodes:
+
`security key-manager setup`
+
The key manager setup starts.
+
NOTE: In a MetroCluster environment, you must run this command on both clusters. 

. Enter the appropriate response at each prompt.
. Add a KMIP server:
+
`security key-manager add -address key_management_server_ipaddress`
+
----
clusterl::> security key-manager add -address 20.1.1.1
----
+
NOTE: In a MetroCluster environment, you must run this command on both clusters. 

. Add an additional KMIP server for redundancy:
+
`security key-manager add -address key_management_server_ipaddress`
+
----
clusterl::> security key-manager add -address 20.1.1.2
----
+
NOTE: In a MetroCluster environment, you must run this command on both clusters. 

. Verify that all configured KMIP servers are connected:
+
`security key-manager show -status`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
