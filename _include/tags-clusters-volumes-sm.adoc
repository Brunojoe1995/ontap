You identify a tag by specifying a key and associating a value to it using the format "`key:value`".  For example: "`dept:engineering`" or "`location:san-jose`".  

The following should be considered when you create tags:

* Keys have a minimum length of one character and cannot be null.  Values can be null.

* A key can be paired with multiple values by separating the values with a comma, for example, "`location:san-jose,toronto`"

* Tags can be used for multiple resources.

* Keys must start with a lowercase letter.
