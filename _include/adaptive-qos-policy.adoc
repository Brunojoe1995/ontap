[NOTE]
Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can set an adaptive QoS policy group template, applying a throughput floor and ceiling limit to volumes in the SVM. You can only apply the policy after the SVM has been created with the `vserver modify` command. The policy only applies to volumes created in or migrated to the SVM after you have assigned the policy.
