SnapMirror technology keeps your data synchronized between on-premises and cloud installations by using ONTAP Snapshot copies. SnapMirror performs block-level incremental data transfers to ensure that only the data that has changed is sent to your destination replica.

Similarly, you can use a SnapMirror vault relationship to create a data archive for the local Snapshot copies created on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

NetApp Cloud Backup Service delivers seamless and cost-effective backup and restore capabilities for protecting and archiving data to object storage in the cloud. Cloud Backup Service is available for both cloud-based data and for on-premises data.
