The iSCSI protocol provides block-level storage to clients such as databases and other applications that want block storage instead of files. ONTAP provides the iSCSI protocol in the cloud.

Once iSCSI storage has been provisioned, there is no difference between on-premises iSCSI access and cloud-based iSCSI access.

The same iSCSI SAN features that are available on-premises such as Snapshot copies, deduplication, compression, and thin provisioning are also available and work the same way in the cloud.
