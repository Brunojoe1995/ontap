AutoSupport proactively monitors the health of your system and automatically sends telemetry to NetApp technical support. You can get detailed actionable information about your systems from NetApp Active IQ Digital Advisor.

The same AutoSupport and Active IQ Digital Advisor features you use on-premises are also available in the cloud. While AutoSupport can't collect data about the underlying hardware that powers Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you still get significantly useful information in Active IQ.
