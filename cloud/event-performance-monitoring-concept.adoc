When you move your on-premises workloads to the cloud, you can continue to rely on ONTAP event monitoring. EMS messages, NAS native auditing, FPolicy, and SNMP are all available in the cloud.

If you are already using System Manager or Active IQ Unified Manager for on-premises performance monitoring, you can continue to do so in the cloud. Both System Manager and Unified Manager provide detailed reporting and alerting of Cloud Volumes ONTAP health, capacity, and performance.
