You likely use the integrated antivirus functionality on-premises  to protect data from being compromised by viruses or other malicious code. This same antivirus protection is available in the cloud when you use Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

The ONTAP Antivirus Connector, installed on a local server, handles communication between the storage system and the antivirus software. For Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you install the Antivirus Connector on a virtual machine in the same cloud as ONTAP.
