You should determine whether your cluster version supports NVE before you install the license. You can use the `version` command to determine the cluster version.

.About this task

The cluster version is the lowest version of ONTAP running on any node in the cluster.

.Step

. Determine whether your cluster version supports NVE:
+
`version -v`
+
NVE is not supported if the command output displays the text "`1Ono-DARE`" (for "`no Data At Rest Encryption`"), or if you are using a platform that is not listed in link:configure-netapp-volume-encryption-concept.html#support-details[Support details].
+
The following command determines whether NVE is supported on `cluster1`.
+
----
cluster1::> version -v
NetApp Release 9.1.0: Tue May 10 19:30:23 UTC 2016 <1Ono-DARE>
----
+
The output of `1Ono-DARE` indicates that NVE is not supported on your cluster version.
