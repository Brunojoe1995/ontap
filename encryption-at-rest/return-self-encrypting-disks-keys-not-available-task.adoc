The system treats a FIPS drive or SED as broken if you lose the authentication keys for it permanently and cannot retrieve them from the KMIP server. Although you cannot access or recover the data on the disk, you can take steps to make the SED's unused space available again for data.

.What you'll need

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.About this task

You should use this process only if you are certain that the authentication keys for the FIPS drive or SED are permanently lost and that you cannot recover them.

.Steps

Not in FIPS-compliance mode, or in FIPS-compliance mode and the FIPS key is available
a|
 .. Set the privilege level to advanced:
 `set -privilege advanced`
 .. Reset the FIPS key to the default manufacture secure ID 0x0: 
 `storage encryption disk modify -fips-key-id 0x0 -disk _disk_id_`
 .. Verify the operation succeeded:
 `storage encryption disk show-status`
 If the operation failed, use the PSID process in this topic.
 .. Sanitize the broken disk:
 `storage encryption disk sanitize -disk _disk_id_`
 Verify the operation succeeded with the command `storage encryption disk show-status` before proceeding to the next step.
 .. Unfail the sanitized disk:
`storage disk unfail -spare true -disk _disk_id_`
 .. Check whether the disk has an owner:
`storage disk show -disk _disk_id_`
 .. If the disk does not have an owner, assign one, then unfail the disk again:
`storage disk assign -owner node -disk _disk_id_`
`storage disk unfail -spare true -disk _disk_id_`
 .. Verify that the disk is now a spare and ready to be reused in an aggregate:
`storage disk show -disk _disk_id_`

a|
In FIPS-compliance mode, the FIPS key is not available, and the SEDs have a PSID printed on the label
a|

 .. Obtain the PSID of the disk from the disk label.
 .. Set the privilege level to advanced:
`set -privilege advanced`
 .. Reset the disk to its factory-configured settings:
`storage encryption disk revert-to-original-state -disk _disk_id_ -psid _disk_physical_secure_id_`
Verify the operation succeeded with the command `storage encryption disk show-status` before proceeding to the next step.
 .. Unfail the sanitized disk:
`storage disk unfail -spare true -disk _disk_id_`
 .. Check whether the disk has an owner:
`storage disk show -disk _disk_id_`
 .. If the disk does not have an owner, assign one, then unfail the disk again:
`storage disk assign -owner node -disk _disk_id_`
`storage disk unfail -spare true -disk _disk_id_`
 .. Verify that the disk is now a spare and ready to be reused in an aggregate:
`storage disk show -disk _disk_id_`
