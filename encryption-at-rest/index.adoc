NetApp offers both software- and hardware-based encryption technologies for ensuring that data at rest cannot be read if the storage medium is repurposed, returned, misplaced, or stolen.

* Software-based encryption using NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) supports data encryption one volume at a time
* Hardware-based encryption using NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE) supports full-disk encryption (FDE) of data as it is written.

You can work with encryption if the following apply:

* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You want to use the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI), not System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
