If you want to make data on a FIPS drive or SED permanently inaccessible, and use the drive for new data, you can use the `storage encryption disk sanitize` command to sanitize the drive.

.What you'll need

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.About this task

When you sanitize a self-encrypting drive, the system changes the disk encryption key to a new random value, resets the power-on lock state to false, and sets the key ID to a default value, either the manufacturer secure ID 0x0 (SAS drives) or a null key (NVMe drives). Doing so renders the data on the disk inaccessible and impossible to retrieve. You can reuse sanitized disks as non-zeroed spare disks.

.Steps

. Migrate any data that needs to be preserved to an aggregate on another disk.
. Delete the aggregate on the FIPS drive or SED to be sanitized:
+
`storage aggregate delete -aggregate _aggregate_name_`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
----
cluster1::> storage aggregate delete -aggregate aggr1
----

. Identify the disk ID for the FIPS drive or SED to be sanitized:
+
`storage encryption disk show -fields data-key-id,fips-key-id,owner`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.

. If a FIPS drive is running in FIPS-compliance mode, set the FIPS authentication key ID for the node back to the default MSID 0x0:
+
`storage encryption disk modify -disk _disk_id_ -fips-key-id 0x0`
+
You can use the `security key-manager query` command to view key IDs.
+

cluster1::> storage encryption disk modify -disk 1.10.2 -fips-key-id 0x0

Info: Starting modify on 1 disk.
      View the status of the operation by using the
      storage encryption disk show-status command.
----
+
. Sanitize the drive:
+
`storage encryption disk sanitize -disk _disk_id_`
+
You can use this command to sanitize hot spare or broken disks only. To sanitize all disks regardless of type, use the `-force-all-state` option. For complete command syntax, see the man page.
