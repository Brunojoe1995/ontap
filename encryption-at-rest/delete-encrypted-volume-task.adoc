You can use the `volume delete` command to delete an encrypted volume.

.Before you begin

* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task. Alternately, you can be an SVM administrator to whom the cluster administrator has delegated authority. For more information, see link:delegate-volume-encryption-svm-administrator-task.html[delegate authority to run the volume move command].
* The volume must be offline.

.Step

. Delete an encrypted volume:
+
`volume delete -vserver _SVM_name_ -volume _volume_name_`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page for the command.
+
The following command deletes an encrypted volume named `vol1`:
+
----
cluster1::> volume delete -vserver vs1 -volume vol1
----
+
Enter `yes` when you are prompted to confirm deletion.
+
The system deletes the encryption key for the volume after 24 hours.
+
Use `volume delete` with the `-force true` option to delete a volume and destroy the corresponding encryption key immediately. This command requires advanced privileges. For more information, see the man page.

.After you finish

You can use the `volume recovery-queue` command to recover a deleted volume during the retention period after issuing the `volume delete` command:

`volume recovery-queue _SVM_name_ -volume _volume_name_`
