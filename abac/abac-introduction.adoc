[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can configure ONTAP with NFS 4.2 Security Labels and Extended Attributes (XATTRS) so that it can be integrated with a role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) identity. This identity allows ONTAP to access control software that is categorized as a NIST ABAC-compliant data management solution.

//ONTAP offers a unified, scalable platform for data storage and management, supporting a wide range of protocols including NFS, SMB/CIFS, s3, and iSCSI. ONTAP's strength lies in its seamless integration with both on-premises and cloud environments, enabling hybrid cloud architectures and facilitating data mobility. It features a suite of tools designed to optimize storage efficiency, such as deduplication, compression, and thin provisioning. Additionally, ONTAP provides robust data protection capabilities, including SnapMirror for data replication and SnapVault for backup and recovery. It's flexibility, efficiency, and comprehensive feature set make ONTAP a top choice for organizations seeking to modernize their data management infrastructure.

== ABAC integration with ONTAP

Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is a sophisticated method for managing access rights that considers user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental conditions. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has established a  standard for ABAC, providing a framework for its secure and consistent implementation. 

This document aims to guide readers on how to utilize NetApp ONTAP, configured with NFS 4.2 Security Labels and Extended Attributes (xattrs), to integrate with a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and ABAC identity and access control software. This integration results in a NIST ABAC-compliant data management solution, offering a robust and advanced approach to managing access rights in complex environments including Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), a Policy Decision Point (PDP), and policies that consider attributes associated with the user, the resource, and the environment. 

The integration of NetApp ONTAP with XATTRS and an ABAC identity and access control software aligns with this framework, ensuring compliance with the NIST ABAC standard. The use of NFS 4.2 Security Labels and XATTRS allows for the association of user-defined attributes with files, meeting the NIST ABAC standard's requirement for considering resource attributes in access control decisions. The ABAC software's PEP and PDP align with the NIST ABAC standard's requirement for these components in the access control process. The ability to define complex policies that consider multiple attributes and conditions aligns with the NIST ABAC standard's requirement for policy-based access control.

ONTAP provides several approaches a customer might use to achieve File level ABAC. They are Labeled NFS 4.2 and XATTRS using NFS and SMB/CIFS. This paper will provide an overview of best practices to implement enhanced RBAC with attributes and ABAC using NetApp ONTAP.

=== Labeled NFS 4.2
Starting in ONTAP 9.9.1 introduced support for the NFSv4.2 feature called labeled NFS, which is a way to manage granular file and folder access by using SELinux labels and Mandatory Access Control (MAC). These MAC labels are stored with files and folders, and they work in conjunction with UNIX permissions and NFSv4.x ACLs. 

.Enable Labeled NFS 4.2
You can enable and disable this feature with the following advanced privilege option:

----
[-v4.2-seclabel {enabled|disabled}] - NFSV4.2 Security Label Support (privilege: advanced)
----

This optional parameter specifies whether to enable security labels for NFSv4.2. The default setting is disabled at the time of creation.

Support for labeled NFS means that ONTAP now recognizes and understands the NFS client`s SELinux label settings. Labeled NFS is covered in RFC-7204.

.Use Cases for Labeled NFS 4.2

* MAC labeling of virtual machine (VM) images
* Data security classification for the public sector (secret, top secret, and so on)
* Security compliance
* Diskless Linux

.Enforcement modes for Labeled NFS 4.2

In ONTAP 9.9.1, ONTAP supports the following enforcement modes:
* Limited Server Mode. ONTAP cannot enforce the labels but can store and transmit them.

[NOTE]
The ability to change MAC labels is also up to the client to enforce.

* Guest Mode. If the client is not labeled NFS-aware (v4.1 or lower), MAC labels are not transmitted.
* ONTAP does not currently support Full Mode (storing and enforcing MAC labels).

.Example configuration of Labeled NFS 4.2
The following example demonstrates concepts using Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 9.3 (Plow). Note that configurations may vary. We illustrate with user `jrsmith`, created based on John R. Smith's credentials, showcasing relevant account privileges.

* Username = `jrsmith`
* Privileges = `uid=1112(jrsmith) gid=1112(jrsmith) groups=1112(jrsmith) context=user_u:user_r:user_t:s0`

This example we will focus on two roles. The admin account that is a privileged user and user `jrsmith`.

[width="100%",cols="26%a,24%a,25%a,25%a",options="header",]
|===
|Users |Role |Type |Levels
|`admins` |`sysadm_r` |`sysadm_t` |`t:s0`
|`jrsmith` |`user_r` |`user_t` |`t:s1 - t:s4`
|===

For this environment, user `jrsmith` has access to files at the levels s0 to s3. We could translate that security classification shown below adding additional security that admins do not have access to user data.

* s0 = privilege admin user data
* s0 = unclassified data
* s1 = confidential
* s2 = secret data
* s3 = top secret data

[NOTE]
Follow your security policies of your organization

.Example of NFS 4.2 Security label with MCS

In addition to MLS there is another capability called Multi-Category Security (MCS), you can define categories such as projects with this feature.

.Policy enforcement point (PEP) and Policy Decision Point (PDP) in ABAC

In an Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) system, the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) and Policy Decision Point (PDP) play crucial roles. The PEP is responsible for enforcing access control policies, while the PDP makes the decision on whether to grant or deny access based on the policies.

In the context of the Python code snippet provided, the script itself acts as a PEP. It enforces the access control decision by either granting access to the file (by opening it and reading its contents) or denying access (by raising a `PermissionError`).

The PDP, on the other hand, would be part of the underlying SELinux system. When the script tries to open the file with a specific SELinux context, the SELinux system checks its policies to decide whether to grant or deny access. This decision is then enforced by the script.

Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how this code works in an ABAC environment:

. The script sets the SELinux context to `jrsmith` context using the `selinux.setcon()` function. This is equivalent to `jrsmith` trying to access the file.
. The script tries to open the file. This is where the PEP comes into play.
. The SELinux system checks its policies to see if `jrsmith` (or more specifically, a user with `jrsmith` SELinux context) is allowed to access the file. This is the PDP's role.
. If `jrsmith` is allowed to access the file, the SELinux system lets the script open the file, and the script reads and prints the file's contents.
. If `jrsmith` is not allowed to access the file, the SELinux system prevents the script from opening the file, and the script raises a `PermissionError`.
. The script restores the original SELinux context to ensure that the temporary context change does not affect other operations.

Using python, the code to get the context is shown below where the variable file path is the document that is to be checked.

----
#Get the current context

context = selinux.getfilecon(file_path)[1]
----

=== Extended Attributes (XATTRS) 
NetApp as of ONTAP 9.12.1 has implemented xattrs. To implement xattrs the following criteria. `setfattr` and `getfattr` are command-line utilities in Linux for managing extended attributes (xattrs) of file system objects. Extended attributes allow metadata to be associated with files and directories beyond what is provided by the system, such as access control lists (ACLs) or user-defined attributes.

*`setfattr`: Sets an extended attribute of a file or directory. The basic syntax is `setfattr -n name -v value filename`, where name is the attribute name, `value` is the attribute value, and `filename` is the name of the file or directory. For example, to set an attribute named `user.comment` with a value of test on a file named `example.txt`, you would use the command `setfattr -n user.comment -v test example.txt`.

`getfattr`: Retrieves the value of a specific extended attribute or to list all extended attributes of a file or directory. The basic syntax is `getfattr -n name filename` to retrieve a specific attribute, or `getfattr` filename to list all attributes. For example, to retrieve the user.comment attribute from example.txt, you would use the command `getfattr -n user.comment example.txt`.

*xattr key value pairs examples*
[cols="2a,8a",options="header",]
|===
|xattr |Value
|`user.digitalIdentifier` |`CN=John Smith jrsmith, OU=Finance, OU=U.S.ACME, O=US, C=US`
|`user.countryOfAffiliations` |`USA`
|===

These tools provide a powerful way to manage additional metadata for files and directories, but they should be used with care, as improper use can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues. Always refer to the `setfattr` and `getfattr` man pages or other reliable documentation for detailed usage instructions. 

.Requirements for using xattrs in ONTAP

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 and Ubuntu 22.04 or later is required.
* Each file can have up to 128 xattrs.
* xattr keys are limited to 255 bytes.
* The combined key or value size is 1,729 bytes per xattr.
* Directories and files can have xattrs.
* To set and retrieve xattrs, `w` or write mode bits must be enabled for the user and group.

*Access Control Entry (ACE) required for xattrs*
[width="100%",options="header",]
|===
|File type |Retrieve xattr |Set xattrs
|File |R |a,w,T
|Directory |R |T
|===

Use cases xattrs are implemented in the user namespace; they have no inherent meaning to ONTAP. Use cases are defined and controlled strictly by the client-side application. 

Some examples include:

* Storing the name of an application that created a file.
* Keeping a link to the email message a file was downloaded from.
* Implementing a categorization system for file objects.
* Tagging downloaded files with the URL the file was downloaded from.

When xattrs is enabled on an ONTAP filesystem, users can set, modify, and retrieve arbitrary attributes on files. These attributes can be used to store additional information about the file that is not captured by the standard set of file attributes, such as access control information.

=== SMB/CIFS
NetApp ONTAP's support for the CIFS/SMB protocol extends to the comprehensive handling of xattrs, which are an integral part of file metadata in Windows environments. Extended attributes allow users and applications to store additional information beyond the standard set of file attributes, such as author details, custom security descriptors, or application-specific data. ONTAP's CIFS/SMB implementation ensures that these xattrs are fully supported, allowing for seamless integration with Windows services and applications that depend on this metadata for functionality and policy enforcement.

When files are accessed or transferred over CIFS/SMB shares managed by ONTAP, the system preserves the integrity of xattrs, ensuring that all metadata is retained and remains consistent. This is particularly important for maintaining security settings and for applications that rely on xattrs for configuration or operation. ONTAP's robust handling of xattrs within the CIFS/SMB context ensures that file sharing across different platforms and environments is reliable and secure, providing users with a seamless experience and administrators with the assurance that data governance policies are upheld. Whether it's for collaboration, data archiving, or compliance, ONTAP's attention to xattrs within CIFS/SMB shares represents its commitment to data management excellence and interoperability in mixed-OS environments.

=== ONTAP cloning and SnapMirror
NetApp ONTAP's cloning and SnapMirror technologies are designed to provide efficient and reliable data replication and cloning capabilities, ensuring that all aspects of file data, including extended attributes (xattrs), are preserved, and transferred along with the file. Extended attributes are critical as they store additional metadata associated with a file, such as security labels, access control information, and user-defined data, which are essential for maintaining the file's context and integrity.

When a volume is cloned using NetApp ONTAP's FlexClone technology, an exact writable replica of the volume is created. This cloning process is instantaneous and space-efficient, and it includes all file data and metadata, ensuring that xattrs are fully replicated. Similarly, SnapMirror, NetApp's disaster recovery and data replication solution, ensures that data is mirrored to a secondary system with full fidelity. This includes xattrs, which are crucial for applications that rely on
this metadata to function correctly.

By including xattrs in both cloning and replication operations, NetApp ONTAP ensures that the complete dataset, with all its characteristics, is available and consistent across primary and secondary storage systems. This comprehensive approach to data management is vital for organizations that require consistent data protection, quick recovery, and adherence to compliance and regulatory standards. It also simplifies the management of data across different environments, whether on-premises or in the cloud, providing users with the confidence that their data is complete and unaltered during these processes.

These PKI entitlements show what John R. Smith can do that includes what type of data they have access to and their attribution.

If John R. Smith created and saved a document called, _"sample_analysis.doc"_. Following the relevant policy guidance issuances the user would add the appropriate banner and portion markings, agency and office of origin and appropriate classification authority block based on the classification of the document as shown in figure 5. This rich metadata is only understandable after it has been scanned by Natural Language Processing and then apply rules to make meaning of the markings. Tool such as NetApp BlueXP Classification can do that but are less efficient for access control decisions as they require permission to look inside the document.

*This is Unclassified*

In the case of the IC-TDF metadata is separate from the file. In addition to this approach, we propose storing the fine-grained access control information at both the file directory level and associated with each file. To keep the concept simple, we will associate several tags with the file. NFS 4.2 Security Labels are used security decision and xattrs for supplemental information related to the file and organizational program requirements.

=== Audit
Auditing changes to xattrs or NFS security labels is a critical aspect of file system management and security. Standard file system auditing tools enable the monitoring and logging of all changes to a file system, including modifications to extended attributes and security labels.

In Linux environments, the `auditd` daemon is commonly used to establish auditing for file system events. It allows administrators to configure rules to watch for specific system calls related to xattr changes, such as `setxattr`, `lsetxattr`, `fsetxattr` (for setting attributes), and `removexattr`, `lremovexattr`, `fremovexattr` (for removing attributes).

NetApp ONTAP FPolicy extends these capabilities by providing a robust framework for real-time monitoring and control of file operations. FPolicy can be configured to support various xattr events, offering granular control over file operations and the ability to enforce comprehensive data management policies.

For users utilizing xattrs, especially in NFSv3 and NFSv4 environments, it is important to note that only certain combinations of file operations and filters are supported for monitoring. The list of supported file operation and filter combinations for FPolicy monitoring of NFSv3 and NFSv4 file access events is detailed in the table 7 below:

[width="100%",cols="25%a,75%a",options="header",]
|===

----

Enabling ONTAP FPolicy for users working with xattrs provides a layer of visibility and control that is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the file system. By leveraging FPolicy's advanced monitoring capabilities, organizations can ensure that all changes to xattrs are tracked, audited, and aligned with their security and compliance standards. This proactive approach to file system management is why enabling ONTAP FPolicy is highly recommended for any organization looking to enhance its data governance and protection strategies.

=== Integration with ABAC identity and access control software

To fully harness the capabilities of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), ONTAP can integrate ONTAP with an ABAC-oriented identity and access management software. In parallel to this paper, we have reference implementation using GreyBox. An assumption for this paper is the Government`s Identity & Authentication and access services include at a minimum a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) and a Policy Decision Point (PDP) which act as intermediaries for access to the file system.

In a practical setting, an organization would employ a blend of NFS security labels and xattr. These are used to represent a variety of metadata, including classification, security, application, and content, which are all instrumental in making ABAC decisions. XATTR, for instance, can be used to store the resource attributes that the PDP uses for its decision-making process. An attribute could be defined to represent the classification level of a file (e.g., "Unclassified, Confidential", "Secret", "Top Secret"). The PDP could then utilize this attribute to enforce a policy that restricts users to only access files that have a classification level equal to or lower than their clearance level.

The PEP's role is to intercept the user's access request and forward it to the PDP. The PDP then evaluates this request against the established ABAC policies. These policies consider various attributes related to the user, the resource in question, and the surrounding environment. Based on these policies, the PDP makes an access decision (either to allow or deny) and communicates this decision back to the PEP. The PEP then enforces this decision, either granting or denying the user's access request as per the PDP's decision.

. User presents credentials (e.g., PKI, Oauth, SAML) to system access to PEP and gets results from PDP.
. PDP provides policy to PEP to enforce.
. Upon Success user requests a file stored in ONTAP (AFF, AFF-C, etc.)
. Upon Success PEP gets fine grain access control tags from document
. PEP requests policy for user based on their certs.
. PEP makes decision based on policy and tags if the user has access to the file and upon success lets the user retrieve the file.

[NOTE]
The actual access may be done via tokens not proxied through.

== ABAC conclusion
By integrating NetApp ONTAP NFS 4.2 Security labels with xattr and ABAC identity and access management software, organizations can establish a robust, NIST ABAC-compliant data management solution. This configuration enables the implementation of complex and dynamic access control policies that not only adhere to standards such as the NIST ABAC standard, but also cater to a broad spectrum of applications and environments. Leveraging ONTAP with NFS 4.2 security labels and xattr for fine grain access integrated with authentication solutions provides a secure, efficient, and regulatory-compliant approach to data management. This capability allows organizations to handle their data with confidence, knowing that access is controlled by a sophisticated and flexible system that meets stringent standards, regulations, and policies.
