The topics in this section show you how to manage cluster health and performance with System Manager in ONTAP 9.7 and later releases.


The System Manager Dashboard provides the following performance information:

* *Health*: You can monitor the health of a cluster.  Alerts are shown when problems arise.

* *Capacity*: System Manager shows you the available capacity on the cluster.

* *Performance*: You can monitor how well the cluster is performing, based on latency, IOPS, and throughput.  The metrics are graphed every 15 seconds by hour, day, week, month, or year.

* *Network*: You can view how the network is configured with hosts and storage objects.  You can view the number of ports that are available and the interfaces and storage VMs that are associated with them.
