[.lead]

NVMe support and limitations vary based on your version of ONTAP, your platform and your configuration. For details on your specific configuration, see the link:https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool].


Protocol support

[cols=3*]
|===

h| Protocol h| Beginning with ONTAP... h| Allowed by...

|TCP
|9.10.1
|Default

|FC
|9.4
|Default

|===

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can configure SCSI, NAS and NVMe protocols on the same storage virtual machine (SVM). 
In ONTAP 9.7 and earlier, NVMe can be the only protocol on the SVM.

== Platform and configuration support and limitations

NVMe/FC and NVMe/TCP protocols are supported as follows.  NVME/FC is supported on the platforms listed below only with 32GB FC HBAs. 

[NOTE]
====
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, 4-node MetroCluster IP configurations are supported on NVMe/FC.  
* MetroCluster configurations are not supported on NVMe/TCP.  
* MetroCluster configurations are not supported for NVMe prior to 9.12.1.
====

[cols=3*]
|===

h| Beginning with ONTAP... h| Platforms h|Max nodes per cluster

| 9.12.1
a| * AFF
* ASA
|12

| 9.9.1
a| * AFF 
* ASA 
| 4

| 9.4
| AFF only
| 4
|===


== Namespace support and limitations

NVMe namespace support varies based on your version of ONTAP. 

[cols=2*]
|===

h| Beginning with ONTAP... h| NVMe namespaces support...

| 9.10.1 
|xref:../nvme/resize-namespace-task.html[Resizing] 

Resizing a namespace is not supported in releases prior to ONTAP 9.10.1.

| 9.8
| LUNs and namespaces can be mixed on the same volume.


|9.6
a| * 512 byte blocks and 4096 byte blocks
+
4096 is the default value. 512 should only be used if the host operating system does not support 4096 byte blocks.

* Volume move with mapped namespaces

|===


Also, when working with NVMe namespaces, you should be aware of the following:

* If you lose data in a LUN, it cannot be restored from a namespace, or vice versa.
* The space guarantee for namespaces is the same as the space guarantee of the containing volume.
* You cannot create a namespace on a volume transition from Data ONTAP operating in 7-mode.
* Namespaces do not support the following:
** Renaming
+
You cannot rename a namespace.

** Inter-volume move
** Inter-volume copy
** Copy on Demand


== Multipath HA pair failover/giveback

Beginning with ONTAP 9.5, NVMe supports multipath HA pair failover/giveback.

== Additional limitations



* The following ONTAP features are not supported by NVMe configurations:

** Sync
** Virtual Storage Console

* The following applies only to nodes running ONTAP 9.4:

** NVMe LIFs and namespaces must be hosted on the same node.
** The NVMe service must be created before the NVMe LIF is created.

See the https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] for a complete list of NVMe limits.
