NVMe support and limitations varies based on your version of ONTAP, your platform and your configuration. 

== Namespace support and limitations

To set up the NVMe protocol in your SAN environment, you must configure an SVM for NVMe, create namespaces and subsystems, configure an NVMe/FC LIF, and then map the namespaces to the subsystems. When working with NVMe namespaces you should be aware of the following:

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can xref:../nvme/resize-namespace-task.html[resize a namespace]. Resizing a namespace is not supported in releases prior to ONTAP 9.10.1.
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.6, namespaces support 512 byte blocks and 4096 byte blocks.
+
4096 is the default value. 512 should only be used if the host operating system does not support 4096 byte blocks.
* If you lose data in a LUN, it cannot be restored from a namespace, or vice versa.
* The space guarantee for namespaces is the same as the space guarantee of the containing volume.
* Namespaces do not support the following:
 ** Renaming
+
You cannot rename a namespace.

 ** Inter-volume move
 ** Inter-volume copy

== Protocol support

h| Protocol h| Beginning with ... h| Allowed by...

== Platform and configuration support and limitations

Support for NVMe-oF protocol varies by platform and configuration.  For details on your specific configuration, see the link:https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool].

NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, 4-node MetroCluster IP configurations are supported on NVMe/FC.  MetroCluster configurations are not supported for NVMe prior to 9.12.1.
