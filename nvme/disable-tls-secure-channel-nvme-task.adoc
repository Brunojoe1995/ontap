Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, you can use System Manager to configure in-band authentication while creating or updating an NVMe subsystem, creating or cloning NVMe namespaces, or adding consistency groups with new NVMe namespaces.

.Steps

. In System Manager, click *Hosts > NVMe Subsystem* and then click *Add*.

. Add the NVMe subsystem name, and select the storage VM and host operating system.

. Enter the Host NQN.

. Select  *Use in-band authentication* next to the Host NQN.

. Provide the host secret and controller secret.
+
The DH-HMAC-CHAP key is a combination of the NQN of the NVMe host or controller and an authentication secret configured by the administrator.

. Select the preferred hash function and DH group for each host.
+
If you don't select a hash function and a DH group, SHA-256 is assigned as the default hash function and 2048-bit is assigned as the default DH group.

. Optionally, click *Add* and repeat the steps as needed to add more host.

. Click *Save*.

. To verify that in-band authentication is enabled, click *System Manager > Hosts > NVMe Subsystem > Grid > Peek view*.
+
A transparent key icon next to the host name indicates that unidirectional mode is enabled. An opaque key next to the host name indicates bidirectional mode is enabled.
