Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1 you can use the ONTAP command line interface (CLI) to configure in-band (secure), bidirectional and unidirectional authentication between an NVMe host and controller over NVME/TCP and NVMe/FC using the DH-HMAC-CHAP authentication protocol.   Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, in-band authentication can be configured through System Manager.

To set up secure authentication, each host or controller must be associated with a DH-HMAC-CHAP key which is a combination of the NQN of the NVMe host or controller and an authentication secret configured by the administrator.  In order for an NVMe host or controller to authenticate its peer, it must know the key associated with the peer.  SHA-256 is the the default hash function and 2048-bit is the default DH group.  

In unidirectional authentication, a secret key is configured for the host but not the controller.  In bidirectional authentication, a secret key is configured for both the host and the controller.

.System Manager
--

In System Manager, you can configure in-band authentication while creating or updating an NVMe subsystem, creating or cloning NVMe namespaces, or adding consistency groups with new NVMe namespaces.

.Steps

. In System Manager, click *Hosts>NVMe Subsystem* and then click *Add*.

. Add the NVMe subsystem name, and select the Storage VM and host operating system.

. Enter the Host NQN.

. Select  *Use in-band authentication* next to the Host NQN.

. Provide the host secret and controller secret.
+
The DH-HMAC-CHAP key is a combination of the NQN of the NVMe host or controller and an authentication secret configured by the administrator.

. Select the preferred hash function and DH group for each host.
+
If you do not select a hash function and a DH group, SHA-256 is assigned as the default hash function and 2048-bit is assigned as the default DH group.

. Optionally, click *Add* and repeat the steps as needed to add more host.

. Click *Save*.

. To verify that in-band authentication is enabled, click *System Manager>Hosts>NVMe Subsystem>Grid>Peek view*.
+
A transparent key icon next to the host name indicates that unidirectional mode is enabled.  only the host secret is configured.  An opaque key next to the host name indicates bidirectional mode is enabled.

.Steps

. Add DH-HMAC-CHAP authentication to your NVMe subsystem:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nvme subsystem host add -vserver <svm_name> -subsystem <subsystem> -host-nqn <host_nqn> -dhchap-host-secret <authentication_host_secret> -dhchap-controller-secret <authentication_controller_secret> -dhchap-hash-function <sha-256|sha-512> -dhchap-group <none|2048-bit|3072-bit|4096-bit|6144-bit|8192-bit>
----

. Verify that the DH-HMAC CHAP authentication protocol is added to your host:
+
[source,cli]
+
----
vserver nvme subsystem host show
----
+
----
  [ -dhchap-hash-function {sha-256|sha-512} ]  Authentication Hash Function
  [ -dhchap-dh-group {none|2048-bit|3072-bit|4096-bit|6144-bit|8192-bit} ]
                                               Authentication Diffie-Hellman
                                               Group
  [ -dhchap-mode {none|unidirectional|bidirectional} ]
                                               Authentication Mode

----

. Verify that the DH-HMAC CHAP authentication was performed during NVMe controller creation:
+
[source,cli]
+
----
vserver nvme subsystem controller show
----
+
----
 [ -dhchap-hash-function {sha-256|sha-512} ]  Authentication Hash Function
 [ -dhchap-dh-group {none|2048-bit|3072-bit|4096-bit|6144-bit|8192-bit} ]
                                               Authentication Diffie-Hellman
                                               Group
 [ -dhchap-mode {none|unidirectional|bidirectional} ]
                                               Authentication Mode
