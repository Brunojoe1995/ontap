Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1 secure, bidirectional and unidirectional authentication between an NVMe host and controller is supported over NVME/TCP using the DH-HMAC-CHAP authentication protocol.   

To set up secure authentication, each host or controller must be associated with a DH-HMAC-CHAP key which is a combination of the NQN of the NVMe host or controller and an authentication secret configured by the administrator.  In order for an NVMe host or controller to authenticate its peer, it must know the key associated with the peer.  SHA-256 is the the default hash function and 2048-bit is the default DH group.  

.Steps

. Add DH-HMAC-CHAP authentication to your NVMe subsystem:
+
`vserver nvme subsystem host add -vserver svm_name -subsystem subsystem -host-nqn host_nqn -dhchap-host-secret authentication_host_secret -dhchap-controller-secret authentication_controller_secret -dhchap-hash-function {sha-256|sha-512} -dhchap-group {none|2048-bit|3072-bit|4096-bit|6144-bit|8192-bit}`

. Verify that the DH-HMAC CHAP authentication protocol is added to your host:
+
`vserver nvme subsystem host show`
+

                                               Authentication Mode

. Verify that the DH-HMAC CHAP authentication was performed during NVMe controller creation:
+
`vserver nvme subsystem controller show`
