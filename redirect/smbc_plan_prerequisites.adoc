//.Protocols
//Using iSCSI and FC protocols, SnapMirror active sync protects LUNs (logical units) in SAN environments which appear as disk devices to physical or ESXi hosts.

//.Host connectivity
//The host-to-storage network connectivity can use either FC or Ethernet (iSCSI) connectivity.

//.Host access type
//The consistency group volumes in a SnapMirror  can be accessed by the application hosts by using either uniform or nonuniform SAN connectivity. Uniform storage access configuration allows each host connectivity to both ONTAP clusters, whereas nonuniform storage configuration enables host connecting to just the local storage array. 

//.Multipathing
//SnapMirror active sync uses ALUA, a mechanism that allows an application host multipathing software with paths advertised with priorities and access availability for the application host communication with the storage array. ALUA marks active optimized paths to the controllers owning the LUN and others as active nonoptimized paths, used only if the primary path fails.
