This topic provides a high-level overview of the process for upgrading an ONTAP cluster from ONTAP 9.7 or higher to a later version of ONTAP 9 using the System Manager interface.

If you need information about any other ONTAP cluster upgrade scenario, go link:./upgrade/index.html[here].

You can use System Manager to upgrade both clusters in a MetroCluster configuration to a newer version of ONTAP.  During the upgrade, the storage service remains online.
