[.lead]
If you need to revert ONTAP to a version that does not support TLS secure channel for NVMe/TCP, you need to disable the TLS configuration on the NVMe hosts.

.Steps

. Remove the TLS secure channel configuration from the host:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nvme subsystem host unconfigure-tls-for-revert -vserver <svm_name> -subsystem <subsystem> -host-nqn <host_nqn>
----
+
This command removes the host from the subsystem, and then recreates the host in the subsystem without the TLS configuration.

. Verify that TLS secure channel is removed from the host:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nvme subsystem host show
----
