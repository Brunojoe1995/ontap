If you created user accounts in ONTAP 9.9.1 and later releases that can access the Service Processor (SP) with the admin role and you revert to ONTAP 9.8 or earlier, the `-role parameter` is reverted to the earlier value. You should verify that the modified values are acceptable.

During revert, if the role for an SP user has been deleted, the "rbac.spuser.role.notfound" EMS message will be logged.

For more information, see link:../system-admin/accounts-access-sp-concept.html[Accounts that can access the SP].
