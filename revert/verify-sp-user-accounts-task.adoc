If you created user accounts on ONTAP 9.8 or earlier, upgraded to ONTAP 9.9.1 or later (when the `-role` parameter
is changed to `admin`), and then reverted back to ONTAP 9.8 or earlier, the `-role` parameter is restored to its original value. You should nonetheless verify that the modified values are acceptable.

During revert, if the role for an SP user has been deleted, the "rbac.spuser.role.notfound" EMS message will be logged.
