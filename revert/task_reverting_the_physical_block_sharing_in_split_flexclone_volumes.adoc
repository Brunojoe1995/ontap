[.lead]
If you have split a FlexClone volume from its parent volume, you must undo the sharing of any physical block between the clone and its parent volume before reverting from ONTAP 9.4 or later to an earlier version of ONTAP.

This task is applicable only for AFF systems when split has been run on any of the FlexClone volumes.

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced: 
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----

. Identify the split FlexClone volumes with shared physical blocks:
+
[source,cli]
----
volume clone sharing-by-split show
----
+
----
cluster1::> volume clone sharing-by-split show
Node            Vserver   Volume        Aggregate
--------------- --------- ------------- -------------
node1           vs1       vol_clone1    aggr1
node2           vs2       vol_clone2    aggr2
2 entries were displayed.
----

. Undo the physical block sharing in all of the split FlexClone volumes across the cluster:
+
[source,cli]
----
volume clone sharing-by-split undo start-all
----

. Verify that there are no split FlexClone volumes with shared physical blocks: 
+
[source,cli]
----
volume clone sharing-by-split show
