Qtrees for FlexGroup volumes are not supported prior to ONTAP 9.3. You must disable the qtree functionality on FlexGroup volumes before reverting from ONTAP 9.3 to an earlier version of ONTAP.

The qtree functionality is enabled either when you create a qtree or if you modify the security-style and oplock-mode attributes of the default qtree.

. Identify and delete all of the non-default qtrees in each FlexGroup volume that are enabled with the qtree functionality:
 .. Log in to the advanced privilege level: `set -privilege advanced`
 .. Verify if any FlexGroup volume is enabled with the qtree functionality.
+
For ONTAP 9.6 or later, use: `volume show is-qtree-caching-enabled true`
+
For ONTAP 9.5 or earlier, use: `volume show -is-flexgroup-qtree-enabled true`
+

 .. Delete all of the non-default qtrees in each FlexGroup volume that are enabled with the qtree functionality: `volume qtree delete -vserver svm_name -volume volume_name -qtree qtree_name`

If the qtree functionality is enabled because you modified the attributes of the default qtree and if you do not have any qtrees, you can skip this step.

. Identify and delete any Snapshot copies that are enabled with the qtree functionality.
 .. Verify if any Snapshot copies are enabled with the qtree functionality: `volume snapshot show -vserver vserver_name -volume volume_name -fields is-flexgroup-qtree-enabled`

 .. Delete all of the Snapshot copies that are enabled with the qtree functionality: `volume snapshot delete -vserver svm_name -volume volume_name -snapshot snapshot_name -force true -ignore-owners true`
+
The Snapshot copies that must be deleted include regular Snapshot copies and the Snapshot copies taken for SnapMirror relationships. If you have created any SnapMirror relationship for the FlexGroup volumes with a destination cluster that is running ONTAP 9.2 or earlier, you must delete all of the Snapshot copies that were taken when the source FlexGroup volume was enabled for the qtree functionality.
