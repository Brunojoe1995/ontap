If you reverted from ONTAP 9.1 or ONTAP 9.0 to ONTAP 8.3.x, SHA-2 account users can no longer be authenticated with their passwords. Passwords must be reset to use the MDS encryption type.

. Set a temporary password for each SHA-2 user account that you xref:identify-user-sha2-hash-user-accounts.html[identified prior to reverting]: `security login password -username user_name -vserver vserver_name`
. Communicate the temporary password to the affected users and have them log in through a console or SSH session to change their passwords as prompted by the system.
