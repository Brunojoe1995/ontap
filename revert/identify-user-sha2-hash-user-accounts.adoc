If you are reverting from ONTAP 9.1 or ONTAP 9.0 to ONTAP 8.3.x, SHA-2 account users can no longer be authenticated with their passwords. Before you revert, you should identify the user accounts that use the SHA-2 hash function, so that after reverting, you can have them reset their passwords to use the encryption type (MD5) that is supported by the release you revert to.

. Change to the privilege setting to advanced:
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----

. Identify the user accounts that use the SHA-2 has function:
+
[source,cli]
----
security login show -vserver * -username * -application * -authentication-method password -hash-function !md5
----

. Retain the command output for use after the revert.

NOTE: During the revert, you will be prompted to run the advanced command `security login password-prepare-to-downgrade` to reset your own password to use the MD5 hash function. If your password is not encrypted with MD5, the command prompts you for a new password and encrypts it with MD5, enabling your credential to be authenticated after the revert.
