To keep up-to-date protection against the latest ransomware threats, ARP/AI (available beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1) offers automatic updates that occur outside of regular ONTAP release cadences. If you have enabled automatic system and firmware updates then you will also be able to start receiving automatic updates to ARP/AI. You can also elect to install ARP/AI update security bundles manually as described in this procedure.

.About this task

For ONTAP 9.16.1 and later, you can only update ARP/AI using System Manager. 

The default method of updating ARP/AI is link:../update/enable-automatic-updates-task.html[automatic updates]. Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, security updates are available in System Manager software downloads in addition to system and firmware bundles.

Manual updates are also available from the NetApp Support Site. These can also be downloaded and installed from System Manager.

//.Before you begin

//You need the following for manual updates:

//* Access to the NetApp Support Site downloads.
//* Subscription to NetApp Support Site download monitoring to be informed of new updates.
//* You have turned off automatic downloads in the cluster settings for security.

== Manually update ARP/AI with the latest security bundle

Follow the appropriate procedure based upon your version of ONTAP and if you are registered with Active IQ Unified Manager.
