.About this task
New volumes are created by default with anti-ransomware in disabled mode, but you can change this setting in System Manager and at the CLI. Volumes enabled by default are set to anti-ransomware in learning mode.

== System Manager procedure

.	Click *Storage > Storage VMs* and then select the storage VM for default anti-virus.
.	In the *Settings* tab, [in the *Security* section], click image:icon_pencil.gif["pen icon"] in the *Anti-ransomware* box, then check the box to enable anti-ransomware for NAS volumes.

== CLI procedure

.	Modify an existing SVM to enable anti-ransomware by default in new volumes:
`vserver modify -vserver _svm_name_ -anti-ransomware-default-volume-state dry-run`
+
At the CLI, you can also create a new SVM with anti-ransomware enabled by default for new volumes.
`vserver create -vserver svm_name -anti-ransomware-default-volume-state dry-run [_other parameters as needed_]`
