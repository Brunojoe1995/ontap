summary: Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) can be enabled on new or existing volumes. You first enable ARP in learning mode, in which the system analyzes the workload to characterize normal behavior, then you switch to active mode, in which abnormal activity is flagged for your evaluation.

[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) can be enabled on new or existing volumes. You first enable ARP in learning mode, in which the system analyzes the workload to characterize normal behavior. Then you switch to active mode, in which abnormal activity is flagged for your evaluation. You can enable ARP on an existing volume, or you can create a new volume and enable ARP from the beginning.

.What you'll need

*	A storage VM enabled for NFS or SMB (or both).
*	The correct license is installed for your ONTAP version.

|===
| ONTAP releases| License
a|
ONTAP 9.8-9.10.1
a|
MT_EK_MGMT (Multi-Tenant Key Management)
a| ONTAP 9.11.1 and later

|===
*	An NAS workload with clients configured.
*	The volume to be protected must have an active junction-path.
*	Optional but recommended: The EMS system is configured to send email notifications, which will include notices of ARP activity. For more information, see link:../error-messages/configure-ems-events-send-email-task.html[Configure EMS events to send email notifications].
* Optional but recommended: Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can enable multi-admin verification (MAV) so that two or more authenticated user admins are required for anti-ransomware operations. link:../multi-admin-verify/enable-disable-task.html[Learn more^].

.About this task

NetApp ARP includes an initial learning period (also known as “dry run”), in which an ONTAP system learns which file extensions are valid and uses the analyzed data to develop alert profiles. After running ARP in learning mode for enough time to assess workload characteristics, you can switch to active mode and start protecting your data. Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, adaptive learning has been added to ARP analytics so that the switch from learning mode to active mode is done automatically. 

Although you can switch from learning to active mode anytime, a learning period of 30 days is recommended. Switching early may lead to too many false positives. The adaptive learning introduced in ONTAP 9.13.1 might determine that a shorter period is sufficient. In the ONTAP CLI, you can use the `security anti-ransomware volume workload-behavior show` command to show file extensions detected to date. It is recommended that you not use this tool to shorten the learning period.

In active mode, if a file extension is flagged as abnormal, but then you evaluate it and mark it as a false positive, the alert profile is refined to so that the extension is not flagged as abnormal in future alerts.

[NOTE]
In existing volumes, learning and active modes only apply to newly-written data, not to already existing data in the volume. The existing data is not scanned and analyzed, because the characteristics of earlier normal data traffic are assumed based on the new data after the volume is enabled for ARP.

To manage this feature in the ONTAP CLI, you can use the `security anti-ransomware volume` command. You can also use the `volume modify` command with the `-anti-ransomware` parameter.

.Steps

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager
--
. Click *Storage > Volumes* and then select the volume you want to protect.
. In the *Security* tab of the *Volumes* overview, click *Status* to switch from Disabled to Enabled in learning-mode in the *Anti-ransomware* box.
. When the learning period is over, switch ARP to active mode.
+
//verify volume route works. Example is Storage VM route
NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can choose *Switch automatically from learning to active mode after sufficient learning* to allow ARP to determine the optimal learning period interval and automate the switch. 

.. Click *Storage > Volumes* and then select the volume that is ready for active mode.
.. In the *Security* tab of the *Volumes* overview, click *Switch* to active mode in the Anti-ransomware box.
. You can always verify the ARP state of the volume in the *Anti-ransomware* box.
To display ARP status for all volumes: In the *Volumes* pane, click *Show/Hide*, then ensure that *Anti-ransomware* status is checked.

.CLI
--
. Modify an existing volume to enable ransomware protection in learning mode:
+
`security anti-ransomware volume dry-run -volume _vol_name_ -vserver _svm_name_`
+
You can also enable ransomware protection with the `volume modify` command:
+
`volume modify -volume _vol_name_ -vserver _svm_name_ -anti-ransomware-state dry-run`
+
At the CLI, you can also create a new volume with anti-ransomware protection enabled before provisioning data.
+
`volume create -volume _vol_name_ -vserver _svm_name_  -aggregate _aggr_name_ -size _nn_ -anti-ransomware-state dry-run -junction-path /_path_name_`
+
[NOTE]
You should always enable ARP initially in the dry-run (learning mode) state. Beginning with the active state can lead to excessive false positive reports.

+
Optionally, for ONTAP 9.13.1 or later, you can enable adaptive learning so that the change to active state is done automatically:
+
`vserver modify _svm_name_ -anti-ransomware-auto-switch-from-learning-to-enabled true`

. When the learning period is over, modify the protected volume to switch to active mode if not already done automatically:
+
`security anti-ransomware volume enable -volume _vol_name_ -vserver _svm_name_`
+
You can also switch to active mode with the modify volume command:
+
`volume modify -volume _vol_name_ -vserver _svm_name_ -anti-ransomware-state active`

. Verify the ARP state of the volume.
+
`security anti-ransomware volume show`
