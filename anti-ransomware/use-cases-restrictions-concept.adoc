[.lead]
The availability of Autonomous Ransomware Protection features depends on the version of ONTAP you are using. 

== Supported and unsupported configurations 

ONTAP platform support:

* The Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) feature is available for all on-premises ONTAP systems beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1.

Suitable workloads:

* Databases on NFS storage
* Windows or Linux home directories
+
Because users could create files with extensions that weren't detected in the learning period, there is greater possibility of false positives in this workload.
* Images and video
+
For example, health care records and Electronic Design Automation (EDA) data.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, ARP is available for these configurations:

* Volumes protected with SnapMirror
* SVMs protected with SnapMirror
* SVMs enabled for migration (SVM data mobility)

Unsuitable workloads:

* Workloads with a high frequency of file create or delete (hundreds of thousands of files in few seconds; for example, test/dev workloads)
* ARP depends on the ability to recognize an unusual surge in file create, rename, or delete activity. If the application itself is the source of the file activity, it cannot be effectively distinguished from ransomware activity
* Workloads where the application or the host encrypts data
ARP depends on distinguishing incoming data as encrypted or unencrypted. If the application itself is encrypting the data, then the effectiveness of the feature is reduced. However, the feature can still work based on file activity (delete, overwrite, or create, or a create or rename with a new file extension) and file type.

Unsupported system configurations:

* ONTAP S3 environments
* SAN environments
* VMDKs on NFS

Volume requirements:

* Less than 100% full
* Junction path must be active

Unsupported volume types:

* FlexGroup volumes (beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, FlexGroup volumes are supported)
* FlexCache volumes (ARP is supported on origin FlexVol volumes but not on cache volumes)
* Offline volumes
* SAN-only volumes
* SnapLock volumes
* SnapMirror Synchronous 
* Restricted volumes
* Root volumes of storage VMs
* Volumes of stopped storage VMs

== SnapMirror and ARP interoperability

Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, ARP is supported on SnapMirror destination volumes. If a SnapMirror source volume is ARP-enabled, the SnapMirror destination volume automatically acquires the ARP configuration state (learning, enabled, etc), ARP training data, and ARP-created Snapshot of the source volume. No explicit enablement is required.

While the destination volume consists of read-only (RO) Snapshot copies, no ARP processing is done on its data. However, when the SnapMirror destination volume is converted to read-write (RW), ARP is automatically enabled on the RW-converted destination volume. The destination volume does not require any additional learning procedure besides what is already recorded on the source volume.

In ONTAP 9.10.1 and 9.11.1, SnapMirror does not transfer the ARP configuration state, training data, and Snapshot copies from source to destination volumes. Hence when the SnapMirror destination volume is converted to RW, ARP on the destination volume must be explicitly enabled in learning mode after conversion. 

== ARP performance and frequency considerations

The ARP feature can have a minimal impact on system performance as measured in throughput and peak IOPS. The impact of the ARP feature is highly dependent on volume workloads. For most typical or common workloads, the following configuration limits are recommended:


[cols="30,20,30",options="header"]
|===
| Workload characteristics
| Recommended volume limit per node
| Performance degradation when per-node volume limit is exceeded pass:[*]

| Read-intensive or the data can be compressed.
| 150
| 4% of maximum IOPS

| Write-intensive and the data cannot be compressed.
| 60
| 10% of maximum IOPS
|===

pass:[*] System performance is not degraded beyond these percentages regardless of the number of volumes added in excess of the recommended limits.

Because ARP analytics are run in a prioritized sequence, as the number of protected volumes increases, analytics are run on each volume less frequently.

== Multi-admin verification with volumes protected with Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP)

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can enable multi-admin verification (MAV) for additional security with ARP. MAV ensures that at least two or more authenticated administrators are required to turn off ARP, pause ARP, or mark a suspected attack as a false positive on a protected volume. Learn how to link:../multi-admin-verify/enable-disable-task.html[enable MAV for ARP-protected volumes^].

You need to define administrators for a MAV group and create MAV rules for the `security anti-ransomware volume disable`, `security anti-ransomware volume pause`, and `security anti-ransomware volume attack clear-suspect` ARP commands you want to protect. Each administrator in the MAV group must approve each new rule request and link:../multi-admin-verify/enable-disable-task.html[add the MAV rule again^] within MAV settings.
