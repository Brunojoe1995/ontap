Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can use the CLI to control the number and retention period for Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) Snapshot copies that are automatically generated in response to suspected ransomware attacks.

*Note*: The `vserver options` command is a hidden command. To view the man page, enter `man vserver options` at the ONTAP CLI.

The following options for automatic Snapshot copies can be modified:

arw.snap.max.count::
Specifies the maximum number of ARP Snapshot copies that can exist in a volume at any given time. Older copies are deleted to ensure that the total number of ARP Snapshot copies are within this specified limit.
arw.snap.create.interval.hours::
Specifies the interval (in hours) between ARP Snapshot copies. A new Snapshot copy will be created when an attack is suspected and the copy created previously is older than this specified interval.
arw.snap.normal.retain.interval.hours::
Specifies the duration (in hours) for which an ARP Snapshot copy is retained. When an ARP Snapshot copy becomes this old, any other ARP Snapshot copy created before the latest copy to reach this age is deleted. No ARP Snapshot copy can be older than this duration.
arw.snap.max.retain.interval.days::
Specifies the maximum duration (in days) for which an ARP Snapshot copy can be retained. Any ARP Snapshot copy older than this duration will be deleted if there is no attack reported on the volume.
arw.snap.create.interval.hours.post.max.count::
Specifies the interval (in hours) between ARP Snapshot copies when the volume already contains the maximum number of ARP Snapshot copies. When the maximum number is reached, an ARP Snapshot copy is deleted to make room for a new copy. The new ARP Snapshot copy creation speed can be reduced to retain the older copy using this option. If the volume already contains maximum number of ARP Snapshot copies, then this interval specified in this option is used for next ARP Snapshot copy creation, instead of arw.snap.create.interval.hours.
arw.surge.snap.interval.days::
Specifies the interval (in days) between ARP surge Snapshot copies. A new ARP Snapshot surge copy is created when there is a surge in IO traffic and the last created ARP Snapshot copy is older than this specified interval. This option also specifies the duration (in days) for which an ARP surge Snapshot copy is retained.
