Configuring protection using SnapMirror  business continuity involves selecting LUNs on the ONTAP source cluster and adding them to a consistency group. 

[IMPORTANT]
include::../_include/smbc-consistency-groups.adoc[]
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, follow the instructions to link:../consistency-groups/configure-task.html[Configure a consistency group] then link:../consistency-groups/protect-task.html[configure protection] for the consistency group using SM-BC; these procedures can be completed using System Manager or the ONTAP REST API. 

== About this task

* You must have a SnapMirror Synchronous license.
* You must be a cluster or storage VM administrator.
* All constituent volumes in a consistency group must be in a single Storage VM.
** LUNs can reside on different volumes.
* The source and destination cluster cannot be the same.
* You cannot establish SM-BC consistency group relationships across ASA clusters and non-ASA clusters
* The default IPspace is required by SM-BC for cluster peer relationships. Custom IPspace is not supported.
* The name of the consistency group must be unique.
* The destination volumes must be type DP.

// The primary and the secondary storage VM must be in a peered relationship

.Steps
. Choose the LUNs you want to protect and add them to a protection group: *Protection > Overview > Protect for Business Continuity > Protect LUNs*.
. Select one or more LUNs to protect on the source cluster.
. Select the destination cluster and SVM.
. *Initialize relationship* is selected by default. Click *Save* to begin protection.
. Go to *Dashboard > Performance* to verify IOPS activity for the LUNs.
. On the destination cluster, use System Manager to verify that the protection for business continuity relationship is in sync: *Protection > Relationships*.

.Steps
. Create a consistency group relationship from the destination cluster.
`destination::> snapmirror create -source-path _source-path_ -destination-path _destination-path_ -cg-item-mappings _volume-paths_ -policy _policy-name_
+
You can map up to 12 constituent volumes using the `cg-item-mappings` parameter on the `snapmirror create` command. 
+
The following example creates two consistency groups: `cg_src_ on the source with `vol1` and `vol2` and a mirrored destination consistency group, `cg_dst`.
+
`destination::> snapmirror create -source-path vs1_src:/cg/cg_src -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst -cg-item-mappings vol_src1:@vol_dst1,vol_src2:@vol_dst2 -policy AutomatedFailOver`
. From the destination cluster, initialize the consistency group.
+
`destination::>snapmirror initialize -destination-path _destination-consistency-group_`
. Confirm that the initialization operation completed successfully. The status should be `InSync`.
+
`snapmirror show`
. On each cluster, create an igroup so you can map LUNs to the initiator on the application host.
`lun igroup create -igroup _name_ -protocol _fcp|iscsi_ -ostype _os_ -initiator _initiator_name_`
+
. On each cluster, map LUNs to the igroup:
+
`lun map -path _path_name_ -igroup _igroup_name_`
. Verify the LUN mapping completed successfully with the `lun map` command. Then, you can discover the new LUNs on the application host.
