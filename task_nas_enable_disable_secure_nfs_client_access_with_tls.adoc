[.lead]
You can improve the security of NFS connections by configuring NFS over TLS to encrypt all data sent over the network between the NFS client and ONTAP. This increases the security of NFS connections. You can configure this on an existing storage VM enabled for link:task_nas_enable_linux_nfs.html[NFS]. 

//tech preview
NOTE: NFS over TLS is available in ONTAP 9.15.1 as a public preview. As a preview offering, NFS over TLS is not supported for production workloads in ONTAP 9.15.1.

== Enable TLS
You can enable TLS encryption for NFS clients to increase security of data in transit.

.Before you begin
Refer to the link:nfs-admin/tls-nfs-strong-security-concept.html[requirements^] for NFS over TLS.

include::./_include/nfs_tls_sm_steps-include.adoc[]

== Disable TLS
You can disable TLS for NFS clients if you no longer need the enhanced security for data in transit.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, and then click *Settings*.
. In the *NFS* tile, click *NFS over TLS settings*.
. In the *NFS over TLS settings* area, select an NFS network interface for which you want to disable TLS. 
. Click the image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] for that interface.
. Click *Disable*.
. In the resulting confirmation dialog, select *Disable*.
