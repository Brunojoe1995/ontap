You can use System Manager to create local tiers to add to your storage solution.

.About this task

System Manager creates local tiers based on recommended best practices for configuring local tiers.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can decide to configure local tiers manually if you want a different configuration than the one recommended during the automatic process to add a local tier.
