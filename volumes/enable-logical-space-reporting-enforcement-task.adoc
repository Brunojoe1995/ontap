Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, you can enable logical space reporting. Beginning with 9.5, you can enable logical space enforcement, or both reporting and enforcement together.

.About this task

In addition to enabling logical space reporting and enforcement at the individual volume level, you can enable them at the SVM level for every volume that supports the functionality. If you enable logical space features for the entire SVM, you can also disable them for individual volumes.

Beginning with 9.8, if you enable logical space reporting on a SnapMirror source volume, it is automatically enabled on the destination volume after the transfer.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, if the enforcement option is enabled on a SnapMirror source volume, the destination will report logical space consumption and will honor its enforcement, enabling better capacity planning.

[NOTE]
====
If you are running an ONTAP release earlier than ONTAP 9.13.1, although the enforcement setting is transferred to the destination volume, the destination volume does not support enforcement so the destination will report logical space consumption but not honor its enforcement.

.Choices

* Enable logical space reporting for a volume:
+
`volume modify -vserver SVM-name -volume volume-name -size volume-size -is-space-reporting-logical true`
* Enable logical space enforcement for a volume:
+
`volume modify -vserver SVM-name -volume volume-name -size volume-size -is-space-enforcement-logical true`
* Enable logical space reporting and enforcement together for a volume:
+
`volume modify -vserver SVM-name -volume volume-name -size volume-size -is-space-reporting-logical true -is-space-enforcement-logical true`
* Enable logical space reporting or enforcement for a new SVM:
+
`+vserver create -vserver SVM-name -rootvolume root-volume-name -rootvolume-security-style unix -data-services {desired-data-services} [-is-space-reporting-logical true] [-is-space-enforcement-logical true]+`
* Enable logical space reporting or enforcement for an existing SVM:
+
`+vserver modify -vserver SVM-name {desired-data-services} [-is-space-reporting-logical true] [-is-space-enforcement-logical true]+`
