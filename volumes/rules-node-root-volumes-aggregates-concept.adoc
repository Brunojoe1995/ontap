You should be aware of the restrictions governing a node's root volume and root aggregate.

[NOTE]
A node's root volume contains special directories and files for the node. The root volume is contained in the root aggregate.

A node's root volume is a FlexVol volume that is installed at the factory or by setup software. It is reserved for system files, log files, and core files. The directory name is `/mroot`, which is accessible only through the systemshell by technical support. The minimum size for a node's root volume depends on the platform model.

* The following rules govern the node's root volume:
 ** Unless technical support instructs you to do so, do not modify the configuration or content of the root volume.
 ** Do not store user data in the root volume.
+
Storing user data in the root volume increases the storage giveback time between nodes in an HA pair.

 ** You can move the root volume to another aggregate.

* The root aggregate is dedicated to the node's root volume only.
+
ONTAP prevents you from creating other volumes in the root aggregate.
