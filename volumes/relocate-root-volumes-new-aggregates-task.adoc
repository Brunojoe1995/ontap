[.lead]
The root replacement procedure migrates the current root aggregate to another set of disks without disruption. You might need to perform this as part of a disk replacement or preventative maintenance process.

.About this task

You can change the location of the root volume to a new aggregate in the following scenarios:

* When the root aggregates are not on the disk you prefer
* When you want to rearrange the disks connected to the node
* When you are performing a shelf replacement of the EOS disk shelves

.Steps

. Relocate the root aggregate:
+
`system node migrate-root -node node_name -disklist disk_list -raid-type raid_type`

** *-node*
+
Specifies the node that owns the root aggregate that you want to migrate.

** *-disklist*
+
Specifies the list of disks on which the new root aggregate will be created. All disks must be spares and owned by the same node. The minimum number of disks required is dependent on the RAID type.

** *-raid-type*
+
Specifies the RAID type of the root aggregate. The default value is `raid-dp`. This is the only type supported in advanced mode.
. Monitor the progress of the job:
+
`job show -id jobid -instance`

.Results

If all of the pre-checks are successful, the command starts a root volume replacement job and exits.
