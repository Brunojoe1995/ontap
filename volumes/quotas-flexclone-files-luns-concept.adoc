You should be familiar with how quotas work with FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs before using them.

Quota limits are applied on the total logical size of the FlexClone files or FlexClone LUNs. Cloning operations do not fail block sharing even if it causes quotas to be exceeded.

When you create a FlexClone file or FlexClone LUN, quotas do not recognize any space savings. For example, if you create a FlexClone file of a parent file of 10 GB, you are only using 10 GB of physical space, but the quota utilization is recorded as 20 GB (10 GB for the parent and 10 GB for the FlexClone file).

If the creation of a FlexClone file or LUN results in the group or user quota's being exceeded, the clone operation succeeds provided the FlexVol volume has enough space to hold the metadata for the clone. However, the quota for that user or group is oversubscribed.
