You can assign an efficiency policy to a volume to run deduplication or data compression operation by using the `volume efficiency modify` command.

.Before you begin
Ensure that you link:create-efficiency-policy-task.html[create the volume efficiency policy] before you assign it to a volume.

.About this task

If an efficiency policy is assigned to a SnapVault secondary volume, only the volume efficiency priority attribute is considered when running volume efficiency operations. The job schedules are ignored and the deduplication operation is run when incremental updates are made to the SnapVault secondary volume.

.Step

. Use the `volume efficiency modify` command to assign a policy to a volume.

.Example

The following command assigns the volume efficiency policy named `new_policy` to volume `VolA`:

`volume efficiency modify -vserver vs1 -volume VolA -policy new_policy`
