When using FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs, you should understand how the space reservation attribute works.

By default, the FlexClone files and LUNs inherit the space reservation attribute from the parent file and parent LUN respectively. However, you can create FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs with space reservation disabled if the FlexVol volume lacks space. This is possible even if the attribute in the respective parent is enabled.

Note that if the FlexVol volume does not contain enough space to create a FlexClone file or FlexClone LUN with the same space reservation as that of the parent, the cloning operation will fail.
