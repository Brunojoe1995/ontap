Depending on your ONTAP release, you can view the physical footprint savings on each volume. You might do this to assess the effectiveness of your administrative processes or as part of capacity planning.

.About this task

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can use the command `volume show-footprint` to view the physical footprint savings on volumes with temperature-sensitive storage efficiency (TSSE) enabled. Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can use the same command to view the physical footprint savings on volumes not enabled with TSSE.

.Steps

. View the volume footprint savings:
