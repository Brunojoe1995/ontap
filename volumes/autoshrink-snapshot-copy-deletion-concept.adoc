Because the autoshrink functionality shrinks the size of a FlexVol volume, it can also affect when volume Snapshot copies are automatically deleted.

The autoshrink functionality interacts with automatic volume Snapshot copy deletion in the following ways:

* If both the `grow_shrink` autosize mode and automatic Snapshot copy deletion are enabled, when a volume size shrinks it can trigger an automatic Snapshot copy deletion.
+
This is because the Snapshot reserve is based on a percentage of the volume size (5 percent by default), and that percentage is now based on a smaller volume size. This can cause Snapshot copies to spill out of the reserve and be deleted automatically.

* If the `grow_shrink` autosize mode is enabled and you manually delete a Snapshot copy, it might trigger an automatic volume shrinkage.
