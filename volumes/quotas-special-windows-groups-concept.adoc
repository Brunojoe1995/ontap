[.lead]
There are several special Windows groups that process quotas differently than other Windows groups. You should understand how quotas are applied for these special groups.

[NOTE]
====
ONTAP does not support group quotas based on Windows group IDs. If you specify a Windows group ID as the quota target, the quota is considered to be a user quota.
====

.Everyone
When the quota target is the Everyone group, a file with an ACL showing the owner is Everyone is counted under the SID for Everyone.

.BUILTIN\Administrators
When the quota target is the BUILTIN\Administrators group, the entry is considered to be a user quota and is used for tracking only. You cannot impose restrictions on BUILTIN\Administrators. If a member of BUILTIN\Administrators creates a file, the file is owned by BUILTIN\Administrators and is counted under the SID for BUILTIN\Administrators (not the user's personal SID).
