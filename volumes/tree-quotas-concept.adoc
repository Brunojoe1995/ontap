[.lead]
You can create a quota with a qtree as its target to limit how large the target qtree can become. These quotas are also called _tree quotas_.

When you apply a quota to a qtree, the result is similar to a disk partition, except that you can change the qtree's maximum size at any time by changing the quota. When applying a tree quota, ONTAP limits the disk space and number of files in the qtree, regardless of their owners. No users, including root and members of the BUILTIN\Administrators group, can write to the qtree if the write operation causes the tree quota to be exceeded.

[NOTE]
====
The size of the quota does not guarantee any specific amount of available space. The size of the quota can be larger than the amount of free space available to the qtree. You can use the `volume quota report` command to determine the true amount of available space in the qtree.
