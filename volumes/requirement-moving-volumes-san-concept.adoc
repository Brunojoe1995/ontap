You need to prepare before moving a volume in a SAN environment.

Before moving a volume containing LUNs or namespaces, you must meet the following requirements:

* For volumes containing one or more LUNs, you should have a minimum of two paths per LUN (LIFs) connecting to each node in the cluster.
+
This eliminates single points of failure and enables the system to survive component failures.

* For volumes containing namespaces, the cluster must be running ONTAP 9.6 or later.
+
Volume move is not supported for NVMe configurations running ONTAP 9.5.
