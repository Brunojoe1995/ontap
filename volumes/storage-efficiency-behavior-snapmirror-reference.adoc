[.lead]
How storage efficiency behaves on a volume when you perform a volume move or SnapMirror operation and what happens when you perform a SnapMirror break and manually enable temperature-sensitive storage efficiency depends on the type of efficiency on the source volume.

The following table describes the behavior of a source volume and destination volume when you perform a volume move or SnapMirror operation with different storage efficiency types, as well as the behavior when you manually enable temperature-sensitive storage efficiency (TSSE).

| TSSE cold data scan 
| TSSE using the same compression algorithm as source volume (LZOPro->LZOPro and ZSTD->ZSTD)
| 8K inline compression attempted in TSSE format
| 32K compression attempted with LzoPro after threshold days based coldness is met on both existing data and newly written data.
| TSSE is enabled. NOTE: LZOPro cold data scan algorithm can be changed to ZSTD.
| 8K inline compression is attempted in TSSE format
| 32K compression is attempted after threshold days coldness is met on both existing data and newly written data.
