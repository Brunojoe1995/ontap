[.lead]
How storage efficiency behaves on a volume when you perform a volume move or SnapMirror operation and what happens when you perform a SnapMirror break and manually enable temperature-sensitive storage efficiency depends on the type of efficiency on the source volume.

The following table describes the behavior of a source volume and destination volume when you perform a volume move or SnapMirror operation with different storage efficiency types, as well as the behavior when you manually enable temperature-sensitive storage efficiency (TSSE).
