Quota resizing is a useful ONTAP feature. And because resizing is faster than quota initialization, you should use resizing whenever possible. However there are a few restrictions you need to be aware of.

Resizing only works for certain types of quota changes. You can resize quotas when making the following types of changes to the quota rules:

* Changing an existing quota.
+
For example, changing the limits of an existing quota.

* Adding a quota for a quota target for which a default quota or a default tracking quota exists.
* Deleting a quota for which a default quota or default tracking quota entry is specified.
* Combining separate user quotas into one multi-user quota.

[NOTE]
====
After you have made extensive quotas changes, you should perform a full reinitialization to ensure that all of the changes take effect.
====
[NOTE]
====
If you attempt to resize and not all of your quota changes can be incorporated by using a resize operation, ONTAP issues a warning. You can determine from the quota report whether your storage system is tracking disk usage for a particular user, group, or qtree. If you see a quota in the quota report, it means that the storage system is tracking the disk space and the number of files owned by the quota target.

.Example quotas changes that can be made effective by resizing

Some quota rule changes can be made effective by resizing. Consider the following quotas:

----

#Quota Target type             disk  files thold sdisk sfile
#------------ ----             ----  ----- ----- ----- -----
*             user@/vol/vol2    50M   15K
*             group@/vol/vol2  750M   85K
*             tree@/vol/vol2      -     -
jdoe          user@/vol/vol2/  100M   75K
kbuck         user@/vol/vol2/  100M   75K
----

Suppose you make the following changes:

* Increase the number of files for the default user target.
* Add a new user quota for a new user, boris, that needs more disk limit than the default user quota.
* Delete the kbuck user's explicit quota entry; the new user now needs only the default quota limits.

These changes result in the following quotas:

----

#Quota Target type             disk  files thold sdisk sfile
#------------ ----             ----  ----- ----- ----- -----
*             user@/vol/vol2    50M   25K
*             group@/vol/vol2  750M   85K
*             tree@/vol/vol2      -     -
jdoe          user@/vol/vol2/  100M   75K
boris         user@/vol/vol2/  100M   75K
----

Resizing activates all of these changes; a full quota reinitialization is not necessary.
