[.lead]
There is a synergy between Snapshot copies and the FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs. If you work with these technologies, you should be aware of what is possible as well as the relevant restrictions.

.Creating FlexClone files and LUNs

You can create a FlexClone file or FlexClone LUN from an existing Snapshot copy. The copy is based on the the parent files and parent LUNs contained in a FlexVol volume.

.Deleting a Snapshot copy

You cannot manually delete a Snapshot copy from which FlexClone files or FlexClone LUNs are currently being created. The Snapshot copy remains locked until the background block-sharing process is completed. If you try to delete a locked Snapshot copy, the system displays a message asking you to retry the operation after some amount of time. In this case, you need to continue retrying the deletion operation. You'll be able to delete the Snapshot copy after the block sharing is done.
