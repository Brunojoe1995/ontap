[.lead]
Qtrees enable you to partition your FlexVol volumes into smaller segments that you can manage individually. You can use qtrees to manage quotas, security style, and CIFS oplocks.

ONTAP creates a default qtree, called _qtree0_, for each volume. If you do not put data into a qtree, it resides in qtree0.

Qtree names must have no more than 64 characters.

Directories cannot be moved between qtrees. Only files can be moved between qtrees.

If you create qtree-level and volume-level shares on the same FlexVol or SCVMM pool, the qtrees appear as directories on the FlexVol share. Therefore, you need to be careful not to delete them accidentally.
