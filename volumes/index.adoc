[.lead]
Using the ONTAP CLI, you can create and manage FlexVol volumes, use FlexClone technology to create efficient copies of volumes, files, and LUNs, create qtrees and quotas, and manage efficiency features like deduplication and compression.

You should use these procedures under the following circumstances:

* You want to understand the range of ONTAP FlexVol volume capabilities and storage efficiency features.
* You want to use the command-line interface (CLI), not System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
