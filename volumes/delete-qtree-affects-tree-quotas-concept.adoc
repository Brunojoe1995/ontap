[.lead]
When you delete a qtree, all quotas applicable to that qtree, whether they are explicit or derived, are no longer applied by ONTAP.

Whether the quota rules persist depends on where you delete the qtree:

* If you delete a qtree using ONTAP, the quota rules for that qtree are automatically deleted, including tree quota rules and any user and group quota rules configured for that qtree.
* If you delete a qtree using your CIFS or NFS client, you must delete any quota rules for that qtree to avoid getting errors when you reinitialize quotas. If you create a new qtree with the same name as the one you deleted, the existing quota rules are not applied to the new qtree until you reinitialize quotas.
