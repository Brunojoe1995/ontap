Although resizing quotas is faster, you must do a full quota reinitialization if you make certain small or extensive changes to your quotas.

A full quota reinitialization is necessary in the following circumstances:

* You create a quota for a target that has not previously had a quota (neither an explicit quota nor one derived from a default quota).
* You change the security style of a qtree from UNIX to either mixed or NTFS.
* You change the security style of a qtree from mixed or NTFS to UNIX.
* You remove users from a quota target with multiple users, or add users to a target that already has multiple users.
* You make extensive changes to your quotas.

.Example of quotas changes that require initialization

Suppose you have a volume that contains three qtrees and the only quotas in the volume are three explicit tree quotas. You decide to make the following changes:

* Add a new qtree and create a new tree quota for it.
* Add a default user quota for the volume.

Both of these changes require a full quota initialization. Resizing does not make the quotas effective.
