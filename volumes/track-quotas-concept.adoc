A tracking quota generates a report of disk and file usage and does not limit resource usage. When tracking quotas are used, modifying the quota values is less disruptive because you can resize quotas rather than turning them off and back on.

To create a tracking quota, you omit the Disk Limit and Files Limit parameters. This tells ONTAP to monitor disk and files usage for that target at that level (volume or qtree), without imposing any limits. Tracking quotas are indicated in the output of `show` commands and the quota report with a dash ("-") for all limits. ONTAP automatically creates tracking quotas when you use the System Manager UI to create explicit quotas (quotas with specific targets). When using the CLI, the storage administrator creates tracking quotas on top of explicit quotas.

You can also specify a _default tracking quota_, which applies to all instances of the target. Default tracking quotas enable you to track usage for all instances of a quota type (for example, all qtrees or all users). In addition, they enable you use resizing rather than reinitialization when you want quota changes to take effect.

.Examples

The output for a tracking rule shows tracking quotas in place for a qtree, user, and group, as shown in the following example for a volume-level tracking rule:
