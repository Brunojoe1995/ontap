Using volume SnapMirror with FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs helps in maintaining space savings because the cloned entities are replicated only once.

If a FlexVol volume is a volume SnapMirror source and contains FlexClone files or FlexClone LUNs, volume SnapMirror transfers only the shared physical block and a small amount of metadata to the volume SnapMirror destination. The destination stores only one copy of the physical block, and this block is shared between the parent and cloned entities. Therefore, the destination volume is an exact copy of the source volume and all the clone files or LUNs on the destination volume share the same physical block.
