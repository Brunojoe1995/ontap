You can specify a user or group as the target of a quota. There are several implementation differences to consider when defining a quota.

A few of the differences you need to be aware of include the following:

* User or group
* UNIX or Windows
* Special users and groups
* Are multiple IDs included

There are also different ways to specify IDs for users based on your environment.
