You can use multiple methods to delete FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs. Understanding what methods are available helps you plan how to manage clones.

You can use the following methods to delete FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs:

* You can configure a FlexVol volume to automatically delete clones with autodelete enabled when the free space in a FlexVol volume decreases below a particular threshold.
* You can configure clients to delete clones by using the NetApp Manageability SDK.
* You can use clients to delete clones by using the NAS and SAN protocols.
+
The slower deletion method is enabled by default because this method does not use the NetApp Manageability SDK. However, you can configure the system to use the faster deletion method when you delete FlexClone files by using the `volume file clone deletion` commands.
