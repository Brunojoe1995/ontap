summary: "Temperature sensitive storage efficiency was introduced in ONTAP 9.8 and is enabled automatically on newly created thin-provisioned AFF volumes. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, new AFF volumes are created by default with 8k adaptive compression on the volume (default mode). If temperature sensitive storage efficiency is desired, it must be explicitly set to enable auto adaptive compression and inline deduplication, cross volume inline deduplication, and cross volume background deduplication on the volume (efficient mode)."

ONTAP provides temperature-sensitive storage efficiency benefits by assessing how often your volumeâ€™s data is accessed and mapping that frequency to the degree of compression applied to that data. For cold data that is accessed infrequently, larger data blocks are compressed, and for hot data, which accessed frequently and is overwritten more often, smaller data blocks are compressed, making the process more efficient.

Temperature-sensitive storage efficiency is introduced in ONTAP 9.8 and enabled automatically on newly created thin-provisioned AFF volumes.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, two volume-level storage efficiency modes are introduced for AFF systems only, _default_ and _efficient_. The two modes provide a choice between file compression (default), which is the default mode when new AFF volumes are created, or temperature-sensitive storage efficiency (efficient), which enables temperature-sensitive storage efficiency. With ONTAP 9.10.1, temperature-sensitive storage efficiency must be explicitly set to enable auto adaptive compression. However, other storage efficiency features like data-compaction, auto dedupe schedule, inline deduplication, cross volume inline deduplication, and cross volume background deduplication are enabled by default on AFF platforms for both default and efficient modes.

Both storage efficiency modes (default and efficient) are supported on FabricPool-enabled aggregates and with all tiering policy types.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, temperature-sensitive storage efficiency adds sequential packing of contiguous physical blocks to further improve storage efficiency. Volumes that have temperature-sensitive storage efficiency enabled automatically have sequential packing enabled when you upgrade systems to ONTAP 9.13.1. After sequential packing is enabled, you must link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/volumes/run-efficiency-operations-manual-task.html[manually repack existing data].


== Upgrade considerations

When upgrading to ONTAP 9.10.1 and later, existing volumes are assigned a storage efficiency mode based on the type of compression currently enabled on the volumes. During an upgrade, volumes with compression enabled are assigned the default mode, and volumes with temperature-sensitive storage efficiency enabled are assigned the efficient mode. If compression is not enabled, storage efficiency mode remains blank.
