You can use quota reports to view details such as the configuration of quota rules and policies, enforced and configured quotas, and errors that have occurred during quota resizing and reinitialization.

Viewing quota information is useful in situations such as the following:

* Configuring quotas, for example to configure quotas and verify the configurations
* Responding to notifications that disk space or file limits will soon be reached or that they have been reached
* Responding to requests for more space
