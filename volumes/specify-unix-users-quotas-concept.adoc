You can specify a UNIX user for a quota in one of several different formats.

The three formats available when specifying a UNIX user for a quota include the following:

* The user name (such as jsmith).
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot use a UNIX user name to specify a quota if that name includes a backslash (\) or an @ sign. This is because ONTAP treats names containing these characters as Windows names.
====

* The user ID or UID (such as 20).
* The path of a file or directory owned by that user, so that the file's UID matches the user.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you specify a file or directory name, you must select a file or directory that will last as long as the user account remains on the system.

Specifying a file or directory name for the UID does not cause ONTAP to apply a quota to that file or directory.
