In a mixed environment, users can log in as either Windows users or UNIX users. You can configure quotas to recognize that a user's UNIX id and Windows ID represent the same user.

Quotas for Windows user name are mapped to a UNIX user name, or vice versa, when both of the following conditions are met:

* The `user-mapping` parameter is set to "on" in the quota rule for the user.
* The user names have been mapped with the `vserver name-mapping` commands.

When a UNIX and Windows name are mapped together, they are treated as the same person for determining quota usage.
