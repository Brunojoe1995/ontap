A volume rehost operation enables you to reassign a NAS or SAN volume from one SVM to another SVM without requiring a SnapMirror copy. The exact rehost procedure depends upon the client access protocol used and the volume type. Volume rehost is a disruptive operation for data access and volume management.

Before you can rehost a volume from one SVM to another, the following conditions must be met:

* The volume must be online.
* Protocol SAN or NAS
+
For the NAS protocol, the volume must be unmounted.

* If the volume is in a SnapMirror relationship, then the relationship must be either deleted or broken prior to volume rehost.
+
You can resynchronize the SnapMirror relationship after the volume rehost operation.
