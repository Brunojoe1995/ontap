Volume rehost enables you to reassign NAS or SAN volumes from one storage virtual machine (SVM, formerly known as Vserver) to another SVM without requiring a SnapMirror copy. The volume rehost procedures depend upon the protocol type and the volume type. Volume rehost is a disruptive operation for data access and volume management.

.Before you begin

Several conditions must be met before you can rehost a volume from one SVM to another:

* The volume must be online.
* Protocols: SAN or NAS
+
For the NAS protocol, the volume must be unmounted.

* If the volume is in a SnapMirror relationship, then the relationship must be either deleted or broken prior to volume rehost.
+
You can resynchronize the SnapMirror relationship after the volume rehost operation.
