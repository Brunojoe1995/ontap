You can use Remote VSS to perform share-based backups of Hyper-V virtual machine files that are stored on a CIFS server.

Microsoft Remote VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Services) is an extension of the existing Microsoft VSS infrastructure. With Remote VSS, Microsoft has extended the VSS infrastructure to support the shadow copying of SMB shares. Server applications such as Hyper-V store VHD files on SMB file shares. With these extensions, it is possible to take application consistent shadow copies for virtual machines that store data and configuration files on shares.
