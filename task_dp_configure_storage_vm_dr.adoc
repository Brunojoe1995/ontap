Using System Manager, you can create an storage VM disaster recovery (storage VM DR) relationship to replicate one storage VM configuration to another. In the event of a disaster at the primary site, you can quickly activate the destination storage VM.

Complete this procedure from the destination. If you need to create a new protection policy, for instance, when your source storage VM has CIFS configured, you should use System Manager to create the policy and select the *Copy source storage VM configuration* option in the *Add Protection Policy* window.
For details see link:task_dp_create_custom_data_protection_policies.html#[Create custom data protection policies].

.Steps

. On the destination cluster, click *Protection > Relationships*.

. Under *Relationships*, click Protect and choose *Storage VMs (DR)*.

. Select a protection policy. If you created a custom protection policy, select it, then choose the source cluster and storage VM you want to replicate. You can also create a new destination storage VM by entering a new storage VM name.

. Click *Save*.
