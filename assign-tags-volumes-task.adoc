Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can use System Manager to assign tags to volumes to identify objects as belonging to a category, such as projects or cost centers.

.About this task
Tags can be added when you create a volume, or they can be added later.

include::_include/tags-clusters-volumes-sm.adoc[]
* Tags assigned to volumes will be deleted when the volume is deleted. 
* Tags are not recovered if a volume is recovered from the recovery queue.
* Tags are retained if the volume is moved or cloned.
* Tags assigned to storage VMs in a disaster recovery relationship are replicated on the volume on the partner site.
