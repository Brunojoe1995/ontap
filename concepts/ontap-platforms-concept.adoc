ONTAP data management software offers unified storage for applications that read and write data over block- or file-access protocols, in storage configurations that range from high-speed flash, to lower-priced spinning media, to cloud-based object storage.

ONTAP implementations run on NetApp-engineered https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-family/#[FAS hybrid-flash systems, All-Flash FAS (AFF) A-Series and C-Series, or All-Flash SAN Array (ASA) platforms^]. Additionally, you can run ONTAP on commodity hardware (https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-select/[ONTAP Select^]) and in private, public, or hybrid clouds (NetApp Private Storage or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/index.html[Cloud Volumes ONTAP^]). Specialized implementations offer best-in-class converged infrastructure (https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/flexpod/index.html[FlexPod Datacenter^]) and access to third-party storage arrays (https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-flexarray/[FlexArray virtualization^]).

Together these implementations form the basic framework of the _NetApp data fabric,_ with a common software-defined approach to data management and fast, efficient replication across platforms.

== Supported OS

* UNIX
* Windows
* Linux
* MacOS
* Virtualized

== Supported protocols

* Fibre Channel
* FCoE
* iSCSI
* NFS
* SMB/CIFS

Across the NetApp data fabric, you can count on a common set of features and fast, efficient 
replication across platforms. You can use the same interface and the same data management tools.
