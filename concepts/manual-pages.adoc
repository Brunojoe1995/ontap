[.lead]
For each major ONTAP release, the commonly available CLI commands (ONTAP manual pages, or man pages) are bundled into a _command reference_. These command references explain how to use the CLI commands in each ONTAP release. Man pages are also available at the ONTAP command line with the `man` command.
