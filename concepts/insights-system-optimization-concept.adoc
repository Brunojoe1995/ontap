h| Insight  h| Severity h| Condition h| Fixes

a| Application is running out of space
a| Needs attention
a| Volumes that are more than 95% full do not have autogrow enabled.
a| 
*Recommended fix*:  
Enable autogrow up to 150% of current capacity.

*Other options*:  

* Reclaim space by deleting Snapshot copies.
* Resize the volumes.
* Delete directories or files.

a| Local tier is running out of physical capacity
a| Needs attention
a| Local tiers are more than 95% full.
a| 
*Recommended fix*: Perform one of the other options.

*Other options*:  

* Enable Fabric Pool to tier the data to the cloud.
* Move volumes to another local tier.
* Enable thin provisioning on thick provisioned volumes to free up trapped storage.
* Delete unneeded Snapshot copies. 
* Delete unneeded directories or files in the volumes.

a| Telnet is enabled
a| Best practice
a| Secure Shell (SSH) should be used for secure remote access.
a|
*Recommended fix*: Disable Telnet and use SSH for secure remote access.

a| Remote Shell (RSH) is enabled
a| Best practice
a| Secure Shell (SSH) should be used for secure remote access.
a|
*Recommended fix*: Disable RSH and use SSH for secure remote access.

a| AutoSupport is using an insecure protocol
a| Best practice
a| AutoSupport is not configured to communicate via HTTPS.
a|
*Recommended fix*:  Change the transport protocol to HTTPS.

a| The login banner is not configured at the cluster level
a| Best practice
a| The login banner is not configured for the cluster.
a|
*Recommended*: Specify the location of the login banner and enable the use of it.

a| Secure Shell (SSH) is using insecure ciphers
a| Best practice
a| The current configuration uses insecure CBC ciphers.
a|
*Recommended*: Remove ciphers that have names containing "cbc", such as "ais128-cbc", "aes192-cbc", "aes256-cbc", and "3des-cbc".

a| Too few NTP servers are configured
a| Best practice
a| The number of servers configured for NTP is less than 3.
a|
*Recommended*:  Add NTP servers so there are at least 3.

a| The default admin user is not locked
a| Best practice
a| Nobody has logged in using a default administrative account (admin or diag), and these accounts are not locked.
a| 
*Recommended*:  Lock default administrative accounts when they are not being used.
