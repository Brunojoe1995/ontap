= System Manager insights
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ./media/

[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, System Manager displays _insights_ that help you optimize the performance and security of your system.  

NOTE: To view, customize, and respond to insights, refer to link:../insights-system-optimization-task.html[Gain insights to help optimize your system]

== Capacity insights
System Manager can display the following insights in response to capacity conditions in your system:

[cols="15,15,20,50"]
|===

h| Insight  h| Severity h| Condition h| Fixes


a| Local tier is running out of physical capacity
a| Remediate risks
a| One or more local tiers are more than 95% full and quickly growing.
a| 
*Recommended fix*: Perform one of the other options.

*Other options*:  

* Clear the volume recovery queue.
* Enable thin provisioning on thick provisioned volumes to free up trapped storage.
* Move volumes to another local tier.
* Delete unneeded Snapshot copies. 
* Delete unneeded directories or files in the volumes.
* Enable Fabric Pool to tier the data to the cloud.

a| FlexGroup volume's capacity imbalanced
a| Optimize storage
a| One or more FlexGroup volumes have a high rate of imbalance.
a|
*Recommended*: Rebalance the FlexGroup volumes.

a| Application is running out of space
a| Needs attention
a| Volumes that are more than 95% full do not have autogrow enabled.
a| 
*Recommended*: Enable autogrow up to 150% of current capacity.

*Other options*:  

* Reclaim space by deleting Snapshot copies.
* Resize the volumes.
* Delete directories or files.

== Security insights
System Manager can display the following insights in response to conditions that might jeopardize the security of your data or your system.

[cols="15,15,20,50"]
|===

h| Insight  h| Severity h| Condition h| Fixes

a| Telnet is enabled
a| Best practice
a| Secure Shell (SSH) should be used for secure remote access.
a|
*Recommended*: Disable Telnet and use SSH for secure remote access.

a| Too few NTP servers are configured
a| Best practice
a| The number of servers configured for NTP is less than 3.
a|
*Recommended*:  Add NTP servers so there are at least 3.

a| AutoSupport is using an insecure protocol
a| Best practice
a| AutoSupport is not configured to communicate via HTTPS.
a|
*Recommended*:  Change the transport protocol to HTTPS.

a| The default admin user is not locked
a| Best practice
a| Nobody has logged in using a default administrative account (admin or diag), and these accounts are not locked.
a| 
*Recommended*:  Lock default administrative accounts when they are not being used.

a| Volumes don't have Snapshot policies
a| Needs attention
a| No adequate Snapshot policy is attached to one or more volumes.
a|
*Recommended*: Attach a Snapshot policy to volumes that don't have one. Otherwise, in case of a ransomware attack, data recover for these volumes might not be possible.

a| Snapshot auto-deletion is enabled
a| Needs attention
a| Automatic deletion of Snapshot copies is enabled for one or more volumes.
a| 
*Recommended*: Disable the automatic deletion of Snapshot copies. Otherwise, in case of a ransomware attack, data recover for these volumes might not be possible.

a| Volumes aren't monitored for ransomware attacks
a| Needs attention
a| Anti-ransomware is supported on several volumes, but it hasn't been configured yet. Otherwise, you might not notice when volumes are being threatened or under attack. 
a|
*Recommended*: Enable anti-ransomware on the volumes.

a| Storage VMs aren't configured for anti-ransomware
a| Best practice
a| Anti-ransomware is supported on several storage VMs, but it hasn't been configured yet.
a|
*Recommended*: Enable anti-ransomware on the storage VMs. Otherwise, you might not notice when storage VMs are being threatened or under attack. 

a| Native FPolicy is not configured
a| Best practice
a| FPolicy is not set for NAS storage VMs.
a|

*Recommended*: Configure the FPolicy in NAS storage VMs to control the file extensions that are allowed or not allowed to be written on the volumes in the cluster. 

a| Active mode isn't enabled for Anti-Ransomware
a| Needs attention
a| Several volumes have completed their learning mode, but active mode hasn't been turned on.
a|
*Recommended*: Turn on active mode for those volumes.

a| The login banner isn't configured 
a| Best practice
a| Login messages are not configured for the cluster or storage VM.
a|
*Recommended*: Setup the login banner for the cluster or storage VM and enable the use of it.

a| Remote Shell (RSH) is enabled
a| Best practice
a| Secure Shell (SSH) should be used for secure remote access.
a|
*Recommended*: Disable RSH and use SSH for secure remote access.

a| Secure Shell (SSH) is using insecure ciphers
a| Best practice
a| The current configuration uses insecure CBC ciphers.
a|
*Recommended*: Remove ciphers that have names containing "cbc", such as "ais128-cbc", "aes192-cbc", "aes256-cbc", and "3des-cbc".

a| Global FIPS is disabled
a| Best practice
a| Global FIPS 140-2 compliance is disabled.
a|
*Recommended*: Enable Global FIPS 140-2 compliance.

== Configuration insights
System Manager can display the following insights in response to concerns about the configuration of your system.

[cols="15,15,20,50"]
|===

h| Insight  h| Severity h| Condition h| Fixes

a| Automatic update isn't enabled.
a| Best practice
a| The EULA hasn't been accepted for the cluster.
a|
*Recommended*: Accept the EULA for the cluster.

a| Latest update to firmware is available
a| Best practice
a| Your system doesn't have the latest update to the firmware which could have improvements, security patches, or new features that help secure the cluster for better performance.
a| 
*Recommended*: Update the ONTAP firmware.

a| Notifications aren't configured
a| Best practice
a| Email, webhooks, or the SNMP traphost is not configured to let you receive notifications about problems with the cluster.
a|
*Recommended*: Configure notifications for the cluster.
