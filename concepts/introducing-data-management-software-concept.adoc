ONTAP data management software offers unified storage for applications that read and write data over block- or file-access protocols, in storage configurations that range from high-speed flash, to lower-priced spinning media, to cloud-based object storage.

ONTAP implementations run on NetApp-engineered FAS, AFF A-Series and C-Series, and All-SAN Flash Array ASA platforms, as well as on commodity hardware (ONTAP Select) and in private, public, or hybrid clouds (Cloud Volumes ONTAP). A specialized implementation offers best-in-class converged infrastructure (FlexPod Datacenter).

Together these implementations form the basic framework of the _NetApp data fabric,_ with a common software-defined approach to data management and fast, efficient replication across platforms.
