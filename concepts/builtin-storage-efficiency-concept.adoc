Beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1, ONTAP provides built-in storage efficiency and data compaction on AFF A70, AFF A90, and AFF A1K platforms. Storage efficiency is enabled automatically and requires no configuration. Storage efficiency is enabled by default on newly created volumes and applied to existing data, including volumes moved from other platforms to AFF A70, AFF A90, or AFF A1K platforms. 

Compression is not based on hot or cold data, so compression begins without waiting for data to become cold.

Storage efficiency on AFF A70, A90, and A1K platforms uses sequential packing for compressed data. 

Data that’s migrated to AFF A70, A90, or AFF A1K platforms using volume move or SnapMirror technology is converted automatically to 32k inline compression. Storage efficiency for data migrated from an AFF A70, A90, or A1K platform to an earlier platform is transformed automatically based on the destination platform’s capabilities.
