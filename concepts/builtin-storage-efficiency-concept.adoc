Beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1, ONTAP provides storage efficiency and data compaction on AFF A70, AFF A90, and AFF A1K platforms. Depending on the platform, compression is performed using either the main CPU or with a dedicated offload processor. Storage efficiency is enabled automatically and requires no configuration. Storage efficiency is enabled by default on newly created thin-provisioned volumes and is applied to existing data, including volumes moved from other platforms to AFF A70, AFF A90, or AFF A1K platforms. 

Temperature-sensitive storage efficiency is not applied on AFF A70, AFF A90, and AFF A1K platforms. Compression is not based on hot or cold data on these platforms, so compression begins without waiting for data to become cold. 

Storage efficiency on AFF A70, AFF A90, and AFF A1K platforms uses sequential packing of contiguous physical blocks to further improve storage efficiency for compressed data. 

Data that's migrated to AFF A70, AFF A90, or AFF A1K platforms using volume move or SnapMirror technology is converted automatically to 32k inline compression. Storage efficiency for data migrated from an AFF A70, A90, or A1K platform to an earlier platform is transformed automatically based on the destination platform's efficiency capabilities.

For information about upgrading a controller to an AFF A70, AFF A90, or AFF A1K, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-upgrade/choose_controller_upgrade_procedure.html[ONTAP Hardware Upgrade Documentation^].
