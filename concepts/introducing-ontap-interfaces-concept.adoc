[.lead]
ONTAP data management software offers multiple interfaces you can use to manage your ONTAP clusters. These interface options provide different levels of access and functionality and give you the flexibility to manage your ONTAP cluster as you'd prefer.

In ONTAP, you can use any of these interfaces to manage a cluster and perform data operations.

== ONTAP System Manager 
ONTAP System Manager is a web-based user interface that provides a simplified and intuitive way to manage your cluster. You can administer common operations such as storage configuration, volume creation, data protection, and network setup and management. System Manager also provides risk and cluster performance monitoring and insights to help you react to and get ahead of cluster issues before they occur. link:ontap/concept_administration_overview.html[Learn more].

The ONTAP System Manager interface was redesigned in ONTAP 9.7 to provide a more streamlined and intuitive user experience. The procedural documentation in this site describes the redesigned System Manager interface, which continues to offer more options with each subsequent ONTAP release.  

NOTE: The older System Manager interface is referred to in ONTAP documentation as System Manager “classic”. 

//If your ONTAP cluster runs ONTAP 9.7 or earlier, you can refer to the System Manager online help. 

== BlueXP
Available beginning with ONTAP 9.x, you can use the BlueXP web-based interface to manage your hybrid multicloud infrastructure from a single control plane while retaining the familiar System Manager dashboard. BlueXP enables you to create and administer cloud storage (for example, Cloud Volumes ONTAP), use NetApp's data services (for example, Cloud Backup), and control many on-premise and edge storage devices. Adding on-premises ONTAP systems to BlueXP enables you to manage all of your storage and data assets from a single interface. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-family/[Learn more^].

== ONTAP Command Line Interface (CLI)

The link:../system-admin/command-line-interface-concept.html[ONTAP CLI] is a text-based interface that allows you to interact with a cluster using link:../concepts/manual-pages.html[commands]. 

These link:../system-admin/different-shells-cli-commands-concept-cluster-admin.html[CLI types] are available based on role and permission level:

*clustershell*: Provides a comprehensive set of commands for cluster management and configuration.

*nodeshell*: Provides a node-level specific set of commands.

*systemshell*: Provides low-level cluster diagnostic and troubleshooting access.

You can access the ONTAP CLI through SSH or a console connection to a node in the cluster.

== ONTAP REST API 
Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, you can access a RESTful API that allows you to programmatically manage and automate cluster operations. Use HTTP requests to interact with the API and perform tasks, such as creating and managing volumes, snapshots, and aggregates, as well as monitoring cluster performance. You can access the ONTAP REST API directly using any programming language that supports a REST client, and use languages such as Python, PowerShell, and Java. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-automation/get-started/ontap_automation_options.html[Learn more^].

== ONTAPI 

ONTAPI is a proprietary ONTAP API that precedes the ONTAP REST API. Beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1, the ONTAPI interface is is available for programmatic management. 

//Beginning with ONTAP x, new and expanded ONTAP features are not manageable with ONTAPI.  

== NetApp toolkits and frameworks
NetApp provides client toolkits for specific development languages and environments that abstract the ONTAP REST API and make it easier to create automation code.
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-automation/get-started/ontap_automation_options.html#client-software-toolkits[Learn more^].

In addition to these native interfaces, you can create and deploy automation code using frameworks. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-automation/get-started/ontap_automation_options.html#automation-frameworks[Learn more^].
