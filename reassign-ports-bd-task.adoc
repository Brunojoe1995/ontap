Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can use System Manager to reassign ports in a broadcast domain.
Every port must be assigned to a broadcast domain.  So, if you want to unassign an Ethernet port for a broadcast domain, you must reassign it to a different broadcast domain.

.Steps

To reassign Ethernet Ports, perform the following steps:

. Click *Network > Overview*.

. In the *Broadcast Domains* section, click image:icon_kabob.gif[menu icon] next to the domain name.

. In the drop-down menu, select *Edit*.

. On the *Edit Broadcast Domain* page, unselect the ports that you want to reassign to another domain.

. For each port, the *Reassign Ethernet Port* window displays. Select the broadcast domain to which you want to reassign the port, and then click *Reassign*.

. Select the ports that you want to assign to the other broadcast domain.

. Click *Save*.
