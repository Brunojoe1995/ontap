Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can use System Manager to reassign Ethernet ports across broadcast domains. It is recommended that you assign every Ethernet port to a broadcast domain.  So, if you unassign an Ethernet port from a broadcast domain, you must reassign it to a different broadcast domain.

.Steps

To reassign Ethernet ports, perform the following steps:

. Select *Network > Overview*.

. In the *Broadcast Domains* section, select image:icon_kabob.gif[menu icon] next to the domain name.

. In the drop-down menu, select *Edit*.

. On the *Edit Broadcast Domain* page, deselect the Ethernet ports that you want to reassign to another domain.

. For each deselected port, the *Reassign Ethernet Port* window displays. Select the broadcast domain to which you want to reassign the port, and then select *Reassign*.

. Select all the ports that you want to assign to the current broadcast domain and save your changes.
