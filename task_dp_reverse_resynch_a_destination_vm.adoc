Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use System Manager to perform a reverse resynchronization operation to delete an existing protection relationship and reverse the functions of the source and destination volumes. Then you use the destination volume to serve data while you repair or replace the source, update the source, and reestablish the original configuration of the systems.

[NOTE]
====
System Manager does not support reverse resynchronization with intracluster relationships. You can use the ONTAP CLI to perform reverse resync operations with intracluster relationships.
====

When you perform a reverse resynch operation, any data on the source volume that is newer than the data in the common Snapshot copy is deleted.

.Steps
.	Select the desired protection relationship: click *Protection > Relationships*.
.	Click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] and click *Reverse Resync*.
.	Under *Relationships*, monitor the reverse resynchronization progress by viewing *Transfer Status* for the relationship.
