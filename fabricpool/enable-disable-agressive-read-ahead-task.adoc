Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can enable and disable aggressive read-ahead mode on volumes in FabricPools that provide support for media and entertainment, such as movie streaming workloads. Aggressive read-ahead mode is disabled by default.
.About this task

The aggressive-readahead-mode command has four options:

* `none`: read-ahead is disabled.
* `file_prefetch`: the system reads the entire file into memory ahead of the client application.
* `sequential_read`: the system reads the entire file or up to a certain point in the file based on the file size ahead of the client application.
* `cross_file_sequential_read`: the system predicts the next file to read based on the extension and reads those files ahead of the client application.

.Before you begin

* You should be a cluster or SVM administrator.
* You must be at the advanced privilege level.

.Enable aggressive read-ahead mode during volume creation

.Steps 

. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----

. Create a volume and enable cloud write mode:
+
[source,cli]
----
volume create -volume <volume name>  -aggressive-readahead-mode <none|file_prefetch|sequential_read|cross_file_sequential_read>
----
+
The following example creates a volume named vol1 with aggressive read-ahead enabled with the sequential_read option:
+
----
volume create -volume vol1 -aggressive-readahead-mode sequential_read 
----

.Disable aggressive read-ahead mode

.Steps 

. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----

. Modify a volume to disable aggressive read-ahead mode:
+
[source,cli]
----
volume modify -volume <volume name>  -aggressive-readahead-mode none
----
+
The following example modifies a volume named vol1 to disable aggressive read-ahead mode:
+
----
volume modify -volume vol1 -aggressive-readahead-mode none
----

.View aggressive read-ahead mode on a volume

.Steps 

. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----

. Modify a volume to disable aggressive read-ahead mode:
+
[source,cli]
----
volume show -fields aggressive-readahead-mode
