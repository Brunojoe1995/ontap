Newly ordered AFF systems come with a free 10 TB capacity term-based license for using non-NetApp object stores (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, IBM Cloud Object Storage, Alibaba Cloud Object Storage, or Google Cloud Storage) with FabricPool, if you select it. If you need additional capacity on an AFF system, if you plan to use non-NetApp object stores with a non-AFF system, or if you upgrade from an existing cluster, you need a FabricPool license.

.About this task

The FabricPool license is a cluster-wide license. It includes an entitled usage limit that you purchase for the AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or IBM Cloud Object Storage, Alibaba Cloud Object Storage, or Google Cloud Storage cloud tier that is associated with FabricPool in the cluster. The usage across the cluster must not exceed the capacity of the entitled usage limit. If you need to increase the usage limit of the license, you should contact your sales representative.

FabricPool licenses are available in perpetual or term-based, 1- or 3- year, formats.

A term-based FabricPool license with 10 TB of free capacity is available for first time FabricPool orders for existing clusters. Free capacity is not available with perpetual licenses.

A license is not required if you use NetApp StorageGRID or ONTAP S3 for the cloud tier. Cloud Volumes ONTAP does not require a FabricPool license, regardless of the provider you are using.

This task is supported only by uploading the license file to the cluster using System Manager.
