[.lead]
If you are running ONTAP 9.2 or later, you can set up AWS S3 as the cloud tier for FabricPool. If you are running ONTAP 9.5 or later, you can set up AWS Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) for FabricPool.

.Considerations for using AWS S3 with FabricPool

* You might need a FabricPool license.
 ** Newly ordered AFF systems come with 10 TB of free capacity for using FabricPool.
+
If you need additional capacity on an AFF system, if you use AWS S3 on a non-AFF system, or if you upgrade from an existing cluster, you need a FabricPool license.
+
If you order FabricPool for the first time for an existing cluster, a FabricPool license with 10 TB of free capacity is available.
* It is recommended that the LIF that ONTAP uses to connect with the AWS S3 object server be on a 10 Gbps port.
* On AFF and FAS systems and ONTAP Select, FabricPool supports the following Amazon S3 storage classes:
 ** Amazon S3 Standard
 ** Amazon S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (Standard - IA)
 ** Amazon S3 One Zone - Infrequent Access (One Zone - IA)
 ** Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering
 ** Amazon Commercial Cloud Services

Contact your sales representative for information about storage classes not listed.
* On Cloud Volumes ONTAP, FabricPool supports tiering from General Purpose SSD (gp2) and Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) volumes of Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS).


.Steps

. Specify the AWS S3 configuration information by using the `storage aggregate object-store config create` command with the `-provider-type` `AWS_S3` parameter.
 ** You use the `-auth-type` `CAP` parameter to obtain credentials for C2S access.
+
When you use the `-auth-type` `CAP` parameter, you must use the `-cap-url` parameter to specify the full URL to request temporary credentials for C2S access.

 ** The `storage aggregate object-store config create` command fails if ONTAP cannot access AWS S3 with the provided information.
 ** You use the `-access-key` parameter to specify the access key for authorizing requests to the AWS S3 object store.
 ** You use the `-secret-password` parameter to specify the password (secret access key) for authenticating requests to the AWS S3 object store.
 ** If the AWS S3 password is changed, you should update the corresponding password stored in ONTAP immediately.
+
Doing so enables ONTAP to access the data in AWS S3 without interruption.

. Display and verify the AWS S3 configuration information by using the `storage aggregate object-store config show` command.
