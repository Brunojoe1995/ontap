[.lead]
If you are running ONTAP 9.5 or later, you can set up IBM Cloud Object Storage as the cloud tier for FabricPool.

.Considerations for using IBM Cloud Object Storage with FabricPool

* You might need a FabricPool license.
+
Newly ordered AFF systems come with 10 TB of free capacity for using FabricPool. If you need additional capacity on an AFF system, if you use IBM Cloud Object Storage on a non-AFF system, or if you upgrade from an existing cluster, you need a FabricPool license.
+
If you order FabricPool for the first time for an existing cluster, a FabricPool license with 10 TB of free capacity is available.

* It is recommended that the LIF that ONTAP uses to connect with the IBM Cloud object server be on a 10 Gbps port.

.Steps

. Specify the IBM Cloud Object Storage configuration information by using the `storage aggregate object-store config create` command with the `-provider-type` `IBM_COS` parameter.
 ** The `storage aggregate object-store config create` command fails if ONTAP cannot access IBM Cloud Object Storage with the provided information.
 ** You use the `-access-key` parameter to specify the access key for authorizing requests to the IBM Cloud Object Storage object store.
 ** You use the `-secret-password` parameter to specify the password (secret access key) for authenticating requests to the IBM Cloud Object Storage object store.
 ** If the IBM Cloud Object Storage password is changed, you should update the corresponding password stored in ONTAP immediately.
+
Doing so enables ONTAP to access the data in IBM Cloud Object Storage without interruption.

. Display and verify the IBM Cloud Object Storage configuration information by using the `storage aggregate object-store config show` command.

The `storage aggregate object-store config modify` command enables you to modify the IBM Cloud Object Storage configuration information for FabricPool.
