You can check if tagging is complete on one or more FabricPool volumes.

.Step

. Use the `vol show` command with the `-fields needs-object-retagging` option to see if tagging is in progress, if it has completed, or if tagging is not set.

vol show -fields needs-object-retagging  [ -instance | -volume <volume name>]

One of the following values is displayed:

 ** `true` -- the object tagging scanner has not yet to run or needs to run again for this volume
 ** `false` -- the object tagging scanner has completed tagging for this volume
 ** `+<->+` -- the object tagging scanner is not applicable for this volume. This happens for volumes that are not residing on FabricPools.
