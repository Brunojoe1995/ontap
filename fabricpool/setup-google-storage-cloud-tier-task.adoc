If you are running ONTAP 9.6 or later, you can set up Google Cloud Storage as the cloud tier for FabricPool.

== Additional considerations for using Google Cloud Storage with FabricPool

* You might need a FabricPool license.
+
Newly ordered AFF systems come with 10 TB of free capacity for using FabricPool. If you need additional capacity on an AFF system, if you use Google Cloud Storage on a non-AFF system, or if you upgrade from an existing cluster, you need a FabricPool license.

* It is recommended that the LIF that ONTAP uses to connect with the Google Cloud Storage object server be on a 10 Gbps port.
* On AFF and FAS systems and ONTAP Select, FabricPool supports the following Google Cloud Object storage classes:
 ** Google Cloud Multi-Regional
 ** Google Cloud Regional
 ** Google Cloud Nearline
 ** Google Cloud Coldline

.Steps

. Specify the Google Cloud Storage configuration information by using the `storage aggregate object-store config create` command with the `-provider-type` `GoogleCloud` parameter.
 ** The `storage aggregate object-store config create` command fails if ONTAP cannot access Google Cloud Storage with the provided information.
 ** You use the `-access-key` parameter to specify the access key for authorizing requests to the Google Cloud Storage object store.
 ** If the Google Cloud Storage password is changed, you should update the corresponding password stored in ONTAP immediately.
+
Doing so enables ONTAP to access the data in Google Cloud Storage without interruption.
