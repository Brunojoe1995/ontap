Unless you plan to disable certificate checking for ONTAP S3, you must install a ONTAP S3 CA certificate on the cluster so that ONTAP can authenticate with ONTAP S3 as the object store for FabricPool.

.Steps

. Obtain the ONTAP S3 system's CA certificate.
. Use the `security certificate install` command with the `-type` `server-ca` parameter to install the ONTAP S3 CA certificate on the cluster.
+
The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) you enter must match the custom common name on the ONTAP S3 CA certificate.

== Update an expired certificate

To update an expired certificate, the best practice is to use a trusted CA to generate the new server certificate. In addition, you should ensure that the certificate is updated on the ONTAP S3 server and on the ONTAP cluster at the same time to keep any downtime to a minimum.
