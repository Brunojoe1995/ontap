Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, if you are a cluster administrator at the advanced privilege level, you can proactively promote data to the performance tier from the cloud tier using a combination of the `tiering-policy` and the `cloud-retrieval-policy` setting.

== About this task

You might do this if you want to stop using FabricPool on a volume, or if you have a `snapshot-only` tiering policy and you want to bring restored Snapshot copy data back to the performance tier.
