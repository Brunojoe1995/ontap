[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.0, you can use System Manager to add a connection to the cloud.

You start by using NetApp Cloud Insights to configure a collector. During the configuration process, you copy a pairing code that is generated by Cloud Insights, and then you log on to a cluster using System Manager. There, you add a cloud connection using that pairing code. The rest of the process is completed in Cloud Insights.

[NOTE]
====
If you choose the option to use a proxy server when adding a connection from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to Cloud Insights Service, you must ensure that the URL https://example.com is accessible from the proxy server. The message "The HTTP Proxy configuration is not valid" is displayed when https://example.com is not accessible.

.Steps

.	In Cloud Insights, during the process to configure a collector, copy the generated pairing code.

.	Using System Manager with ONTAP 9.9.0 or later, log on to the cluster.

.	Go to *Cluster > Settings*.

.	In the Cloud Connections section, select *Add* to add a connection.
