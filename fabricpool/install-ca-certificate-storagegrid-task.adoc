[.lead]
Unless you plan to disable certificate checking for StorageGRID, you must install a StorageGRID CA certificate on the cluster so that ONTAP can authenticate with StorageGRID as the object store for FabricPool.

.About this task

ONTAP 9.4 and later releases enable you to disable certificate checking for StorageGRID.

.Steps

. Contact your StorageGRID administrator to obtain the StorageGRID system's CA certificate.
. Use the `security certificate install` command with the `-type` `server-ca` parameter to install the StorageGRID CA certificate on the cluster.
+
The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) you enter must match the custom common name on the StorageGRID CA certificate.


== Update an expired certificate

To update an expired certificate, the best practice is to use a trusted CA to generate the new server certificate. In addition, you should ensure that the certificate is updated on the StorageGRID server and on the ONTAP cluster at the same time to keep any downtime to a minimum.
