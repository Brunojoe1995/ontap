You can reassign the object store mirror as the primary object store by promoting it. When the object store mirror becomes the primary, the original primary automatically becomes the mirror.

.What you'll need

* The FabricPool mirror must be in sync
* The object store must be operational

.About this task

You can replace the original object store with an object store from a different cloud provider. For instance, your original mirror might be an AWS object store, but you can replace it with an Azure object store.

.Step

. Promote an object store mirror by using the `storage aggregate object-store modify -aggregate` command.
