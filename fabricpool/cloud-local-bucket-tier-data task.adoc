Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can tier data to local object storage using ONTAP S3.

Tiering data to a local bucket provides a simple alternative to moving data to a different local tier. This procedure uses an existing bucket on the local cluster, or you can let ONTAP automatically create a new storage VM and a new bucket.

Keep in mind that once you attach to a local tier (aggregate) the cloud tier cannot be unattached.

An S3 license is required for this workflow, which creates a new S3 server and new bucket, or uses existing ones. A FabricPool license is not required for this workflow.

.Step
. Tier data to a local bucket: click *Tiers*, select a tier, then click image:icon_kabob.gif[kabob icon].
. If necessary, enable thin provisioning.
. Choose an existing tier or create a new one.
. If necessary, edit the existing tiering policy.
