[.lead]
If you are running ONTAP 9.8 or later, you can set up ONTAP S3 as the cloud tier for FabricPool.

.What you'll need

You must have the ONTAP S3 server name and the IP address of its associated LIFs on the remote cluster.

There must be intercluster LIFs on both local and remote clusters.

https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.pow-s3-cg/GUID-47BBD9BF-7C3A-4902-8E41-88E54A0FDB44.html[Creating intercluster LIFs for remote FabricPool tiering]

.About this task

Load balancing is enabled for ONTAP S3 servers in ONTAP 9.8 and later. When the server's hostname resolves to more than one IP address, ONTAP establishes client connections with all the IP addresses returned (up to a maximum of 16 IP addresses). The IP addresses are picked up in a round-robin method when connections are established.

.Procedures

You can set up ONTAP S3 as the cloud tier for FabricPool with ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

.System Manager
--

. Click *Storage > Tiers > Add Cloud Tier* and select ONTAP S3 as the object store provider.
. Complete the requested information.
. If you want to create a cloud mirror, click *Add as FabricPool Mirror*.

A FabricPool mirror provides a method for you to seamlessly replace a data store, and it helps to ensure that your data is available in the event of disaster.
--
.CLI
--

. Add entries for the S3 server and LIFs to your DNS server.

h| Option h|Description

a|
*If you use an external DNS server*
a|
Give the S3 server name and IP addresses to the DNS server administrator.
a|
*If you use your local system's DNS hosts table*
a|
Enter the following command:

`dns host create -vserver svm_name -address ip_address -hostname s3_server_name`
|===

. Specify the ONTAP S3 configuration information by using the `storage aggregate object-store config create` command with the `-provider-type` `ONTAP_S3` parameter.
 ** The `storage aggregate object-store config create` command fails if the local ONTAP system cannot access the ONTAP S3 server with the information provided.
 ** You use the `-access-key` parameter to specify the access key for authorizing requests to the ONTAP S3 server.
 ** You use the `-secret-password` parameter to specify the password (secret access key) for authenticating requests to the ONTAP S3 server.
 ** If the ONTAP S3 server password is changed, you should immediately update the corresponding password stored in the local ONTAP system.
+
Doing so enables access to the data in the ONTAP S3 object store without interruption.

 ** Setting the `-is-certificate-validation-enabled` parameter to `false` disables certificate checking for ONTAP S3.

-object-store-name myS3 -provider-type ONTAP_S3 -server myS3server
-container-name myS3container -access-key myS3key

. Display and verify the ONTAP_S3 configuration information by using the `storage aggregate object-store config show` command.
+
The `storage aggregate object-store config modify` command enables you to modify the `ONTAP_S3` configuration information for FabricPool.
