[.lead]
After setting up an object store as the cloud tier, you specify the aggregate to use by attaching it to FabricPool. In ONTAP 9.5 and later, you can also attach aggregates that contain qualified FlexGroup volume constituents.

.What you'll need

When you use the ONTAP CLI to set up an aggregate for FabricPool, the aggregate must already exist.

[NOTE]
====
When you use System Manager to set up an aggregate for FabricPool, you can create the aggregate and set it up to use for FabricPool at the same time.

.Steps

. *Optional*: To see how much data in a volume is inactive, follow the steps in link:determine-data-inactive-reporting-task.html[Determining how much data in a volume is inactive by using inactive data reporting].
+
Seeing how much data in a volume is inactive can help you decide which aggregate to use for FabricPool.

. Attach the object store to an aggregate by using the `storage aggregate object-store attach` command.
+
If the aggregate has never been used with FabricPool and it contains existing volumes, then the volumes are assigned the default `snapshot-only` tiering policy.

+
You can use the `allow-flexgroup` `true` option to attach aggregates that contain FlexGroup volume constituents.

. Display the object store information and verify that the attached object store is available by using the `storage aggregate object-store show` command.
