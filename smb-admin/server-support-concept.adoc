[.lead]
You can enable and configure SMB servers on storage virtual machines (SVMs) to let SMB clients access files on your cluster.

* Each data SVM in the cluster can be bound to exactly one Active Directory domain.
* Data SVMs do not need to be bound to the same domain.
* Multiple SVMs can be bound to the same domain.

You must configure the SVMs and LIFs that you are using to serve data before you can create an SMB server. If your data network is not flat, you might also need to configure IPspaces, broadcast domains, and subnets. The _Network Management Guide_ contains details.
