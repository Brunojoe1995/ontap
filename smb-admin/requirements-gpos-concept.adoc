To use Group Policy Objects (GPOs) with your SMB server, your system must meet several requirements.

* SMB must be licensed on the cluster. The SMB license is included with link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html#licenses-included-with-ontap-one[ONTAP One]. If you don't have ONTAP One and the license is not installed, contact your sales representative. 
* A SMB server must be configured and joined to a Windows Active Directory domain.
* The SMB server admin status must be on.
* GPOs must be configured and applied to the Windows Active Directory Organizational Unit (OU) containing the SMB server computer object.
* GPO support must be enabled on the SMB server.
