== Feature highlights

Features have been upgraded in the follow areas:

=== Data protection 

[cols=2,options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| Multi-admin verification
a| Cluster administrator can explicitly enable multi-admin verification on a cluster to require quorum approval before some SnapLock operations are executed. + 
link:../snaplock/index.html#multi-admin-verification-mav-support.md[What SnapLock is]
| Enhanced support for managing consistency groups including volume move and geometry
a| You can move volumes between consistency groups, modify the geometry of hierarchical consistency groups, and gain capacity insights into consistency groups. System Manager supports creating a consistency group with new NAS volumes or NVME namespaces. +
link:../consistency-groups/index.html[Consistency groups overview]

=== File access protocols

[cols=2,options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| link:../nfs-admin/manage-nfsv4-storepool-controls-task.html[NFSv4.x storepool support] | A few clients consume too many NFSv4.x storepool resources leading to other NFSv4.x clients getting blocked due to unavailability of NFSv4.x storepool resources. You can have the option to enable denying and blocking of clients who consume a lot of NFSv4.x storepool resource in their environments.

=== MetroCluster 

Learn link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster[What's new in MetroCluster^].

=== Networking and security protocols

[cols=2,options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| Increased data LIF limits | ONTAP provides greater flexibility by increasing data LIF scaling limits for both HA pairs and clusters.
| X.509 certificates with SSH public keys
| ONTAP enables you to associate an X.509 certificate with the SSH public key for an account, giving you the added security of certificate expiration and revocation checks upon SSH login.
| IPv6 during cluster setup on the A800 and FAS8700 platforms
| On the A800 and FAS8700 platforms, you can use the ONTAP CLI to create and configure new clusters in IPv6-only networking environments.
| SSH public key authentication with Active Directory
| You can use an SSH public key as your primary authentication method with an Active Directory (AD) user, or you can use an SSH public key as your secondary authentication method after an AD user. See xref:../authentication/grant-access-active-directory-users-groups-task.html[Enable Active Directory account access]
| xref:../authentication/setup-ssh-multifactor-authentication-task.html#enable-mfa-with-totp[Multifactor authentication with TOTP (time-based one-time passwords)]
| You can set up local user accounts with multifactor authentication using a time-based one-time password (TOTP). The TOTP is always used as the second authentication method. You can use an SSH public key or user password as your primary authentication method.
| xref:../nas-audit/create-fpolicy-event-task.html[FPolicy file access failure notification]
| FPolicy supports notifications for access denied events. Notifications will be generated for file operation failed due to lack of permission, which includes: failure due to NTFS permissions, failure due to Unix mode bits, and failure due to NFSv4 ACLs.
|===

=== S3 object storage 

[cols=2,options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| xref:../s3-config/create-bucket-lifecycle-rule-task.html[S3 bucket lifecycle management]
| S3 object expiration actions define when objects in a bucket expire. This capability enables you to manage object versions so you can meet retention requirements and manage overall S3 object storage effectively.
|===

=== SAN 

[cols=2,options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| xref:..san-admin/create-nvme-namespace-subsystem-task.html[NVMe/FC on AIX hosts]
| ONTAP supports the NVMe/FC protocol on AIX hosts. See the NetApp Interoperability Tool for supported configurations.
|===

=== Security  

[cols=2,options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Description 
| xref:../anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection]
a|
* Multi-admin verify functionality with Autonomous Ransomware Protection
* Automatic transition from learning to active mode
* FlexGroup support 
|===

=== Storage efficiency  

In October 2022, NetApp will implement changes to reject AutoSupport message transmissions that are not sent by either HTTPS with TLSv1.2 or secure SMTP. For more information, see link:https://kb.netapp.com/Support_Bulletins/Customer_Bulletins/SU484[xSU484: NetApp will reject AutoSupport messages transmitted with insufficient transport security^].

| Update | Description 
| Change in reporting of primary data reduction ratio in System Manager
| The primary data reduction ratio displayed in System Manager no longer includes Snapshot copy space savings in the calculation. It only depicts the ratio between used logical and used physical space. In prior releases of ONTAP, the primary data reduction ratio included significant space reduction benefits of Snapshot copies. As a result, when you upgrade to ONTAP 9.13.1, you will observe a significantly lower primary ratio being reported. You can still see data reduction ratios with Snapshot copies in the Capacity details view.
| xref:../volumes/enable-temperature-sensitive-efficiency-concept.html[Temperature-sensitive storage efficiency]
| Temperature-sensitive storage efficiency adds sequential packing of contiguous physical blocks to improve storage efficiency. Volumes that have temperature-sensitive storage efficiency enabled will automatically have sequential packing enabled when systems are upgraded to ONTAP 9.13.1.
| Logical space enforcement
| Logical space enforcement is supported on SnapMirror destinations.
| xref:../volumes/manage-svm-capacity.html[Storage VM capacity limits support]
| You can set capacity limits on a storage VM (SVM) and enable alerts when the SVM is approaching a percentage threshold.

=== System Manager 

Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, System Manager is integrated with BlueXP. With BlueXP, administrators can manage the hybrid multicloud infrastructure from a single control plane while retaining the familiar System Manager dashboard. When signing into System Manager, administrators are given the option of accessing the System Manager interface in BlueXP or accessing System Manager directly. Learn more about xref:../ontap/sysmgr-integration-bluexp-concept.html[System Manager integration with BlueXP].

| xref:../snaplock/snapshot-lock-concept.html#enable-snapshot-copy-locking-when-creating-a-volume[Tamperproof Snapshot copy locking]
| You can use System Manager to lock a Snapshot copy on a nonSnapLock volume to provide protection from ransomware attacks.
| xref:../encryption-at-rest/manage-external-key-managers-sm-task.html[Support for managing external key manager]
| You can use System Manager to manage external key managers to store and manage authentication and encryption keys.
