a| 
* xref:../snaplock/snapshot-lock-concept.html[Tamper-proof Snapshots]
+
With SnapLock technology, , Snapshot copies can now be protected from deletion on either the source or destination.
+
Retain more recovery points by protecting snapshots on primary and secondary storage from deletion by ransomware attackers or rogue administrators
* xref:../anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous ransomware protection (ARP) enhancements]
+
Immediately enable intelligent autonomous ransomware protection on secondary storage, based on the screening model already completed for the primary storage. 
+
After a failover, instantly identify potential ransomware attacks on secondary storage. A Snapshot is immediately taken of the data that is starting to be affected, and administrators are notified, helping to stop an attack and enhance recovery. 
* xref:../nas-audit/plan-fpolicy-event-config-concept.html[FPolicy]
+
One-click activation of ONTAP FPolicy to enable automatic blocking of known malicious files The simplified activation helps to protect against typical ransomware attacks that use common, known file extensions.
* xref:../system-admin/ontap-implements-audit-logging-concept.html[Security hardening: Tamperproof retention logging]
+
Tamperproof retention logging in ONTAP insuring compromised administrator accounts cannot hide malicious actions. Admin and user history cannot be altered or deleted without the systems knowledge. 
+
Log and audit all admin actions regardless of origin guaranteeing all actions impacting data are captured. An alert is generated whenever system audit logs have been tampered with in any way notifying administrators of the change.
* xref:../authentication/setup-ssh-multifactor-authentication-task.html[Security hardening: Expanded multifactor authentication]
+
Multifactor authentication (MFA) for CLI (SSH) supports Yubikey physical hardware token devices ensuring that an attacker cannot access the ONTAP system using stolen credentials or a compromised client system. Cisco DUO is now supported for MFA with System Manager.
* File-object duality (multi-protocol access)
+
File-object duality enables native S3 protocol read and write access to the same data source that already has NAS protocol access. You can concurrently access your storage as files or as objects from the same data source, eliminating the need for duplicate copies of data for use with different protocols (S3 or NAS), such as for analytics that use object data.
* xref:../flexgroup/manage-flexgroup-rebalance-task.html[FlexGroup rebalancing]
+
In the event FlexGroup constituents become unbalanced, FlexGroup can now nondisruptively be rebalanced and managed from
CLI, REST API, and System Manager. For optimal performance, constituent members within a FlexGroup should have their used capacity evenly distributed.
* Storage capacity enhancements
+
WAFL Space Reservation has been significantly reduced, providing up to 400 TiB more usable capacity per aggregate.
| ONTAP 9.11.1
a |
* Multiadmin verification
+ 
Prevent malicious and accidental changes to your data by making sure that a single cluster administrator, or a ransomware
attacker with a compromised administrator account, cannot execute sensitive commands without approvals from one or more additional administrators.
