You can perform tape backup and restore operations at the storage virtual machine (SVM) level successfully if the NDMP service is enabled on the SVM. You can back up and restore all volumes hosted across different nodes in the SVM of a cluster if the backup application supports the CAB extension.

An NDMP control connection can be established on different LIF types. In the SVM-scoped NDMP mode, these LIFs belong to either the data SVM or admin SVM. The connection can be established on a LIF only if the NDMP service is enabled on the SVM that owns this LIF.

A data LIF belongs to the data SVM and the intercluster LIF, node-management LIF, and cluster-management LIF belong to the admin SVM.

In the SVM-scoped NDMP mode, the availability of volumes and tape devices for backup and restore operations depends on the LIF type on which the NDMP control connection is established and the status of the CAB extension. If your backup application supports the CAB extension and a volume and the tape device share the same affinity, then the backup application can perform a local backup or restore operation, instead of a three-way backup or restore operation.
