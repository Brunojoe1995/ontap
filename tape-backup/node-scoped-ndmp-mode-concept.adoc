In the node-scoped NDMP mode, you can perform tape backup and restore operations at the node level. The NDMP mode of operation used in Data ONTAP 8.2 will continue to be retained post the upgrade from 8.2 to 8.3.

In the node-scoped NDMP mode, you can perform tape backup and restore operations on a node that owns the volume. To perform these operations, you must establish NDMP control connections on a LIF hosted on the node that owns the volume or tape devices.

[NOTE]
====
This mode is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release.
