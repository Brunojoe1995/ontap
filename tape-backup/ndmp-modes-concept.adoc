[.lead]
You can choose to perform tape backup and restore operations either at the node level or at the storage virtual machine (SVM) level. To perform these operations successfully at the SVM level, NDMP service must be enabled on the SVM.

If you upgrade from Data ONTAP 8.2 to Data ONTAP 8.3, the NDMP mode of operation used in 8.2 will continue to be retained post the upgrade from 8.2 to 8.3.

If you install a new cluster with Data ONTAP 8.2 or later, NDMP is in the SVM-scoped NDMP mode by default. To perform tape backup and restore operations in the node-scoped NDMP mode, you must explicitly enable the node-scoped NDMP mode.
