[lead]
Trunking must be explicitly enabled on NFS servers running NFSv4.1 and later. NFSv4.1 and later are enabled by default when NFS servers are created.

The SVM that contains the NFS server should be dedicated to NFS trunking. If other NAS servers are present, they should be deleted and their exported shares moved to another SVM.

After enabling trunking, verify that the following services are configured as needed.

* link:../nfs-config/configure-dns-host-name-resolution-task.html[DNS]
* link:../nfs-config/using-ldap-concept.html[LDAP]
* link:../nfs-config/kerberos-nfs-strong-security-concept.html[Kerberos]

.Steps 

. Enable trunking and ensure that NFSv4.1 is enabled:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nfs create -vserver "<svm_name>" -v4.1 enabled -v4.1-trunking enabled
----

. Verify that NFS is running:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nfs status -vserver "<svm_name>"
----

. Verify that NFS is configured as desired:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nfs show -vserver "<svm_name>"
----
+
Learn more about link:../nfs-config/create-server-task.html[NFS server configuration.]

. If you are serving to Windows clients from this SVM, delete the server after moving the shares.
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver cifs show -vserver "<svm_name_>"

vserver cifs delete -vserver "<svm_name>"
