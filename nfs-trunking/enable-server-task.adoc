[lead]
Trunking must be explicitly enabled on NFS servers. NFSv4.1 is enabled by default when NFS servers are created.

The SVM that contains the NFS server should be dedicated to NFSv4.1 trunking. If other NAS servers are present, they should be deleted and their exported shares moved to another SVM.

After enabling trunking, verify that the following services are configured as needed.
* link:../nfs-config/configure-dns-host-name-resolution-task.html[DNS]
* link:../nfs-config/using-ldap-concept.html[LDAP]
* link:../nfs-config/kerberos-nfs-strong-security-concept.html[Kerberos]

.Steps 

. Enable trunking and ensure that NFSv4.1 is enabled:
+
`vserver nfs create -vserver _svm_name_ -v4.1 enabled -v4.1-trunking enabled`
+
Verify that NFS is running:
+
`vserver nfs status -vserver _svm_name_`
+
Verify that NFS is configured as desired:
+
`vserver nfs show -vserver _svm_name_`
+
Learn more about link:../nfs-config/create-server-task.html[NFS server configuration.]

. If you are serving to Windows clients from this SVM, delete the server after moving the shares.
+
`vserver cifs show -vserver _svm_name_`
+
`vserver cifs delete -vserver _svm_name_`
