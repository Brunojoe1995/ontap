To enable clients to to take advantage of trunking for existing data shares, you might have to modify export policies and rules, and the volumes to which they are attached. There are different export requirements for Linux clients and VMware datastores. 
*<qtrees?>*

If you are upgrading to 9.12.1 and you have already exported a volume, you can continue to use that volume in a trunking group. However, you might need to create additional volumes for Linux clients. This is because Linux clients must have a separate mount for each trunking connection (that is, for each LIF). The mounts can be two or more exported volumes mounted at the same mount point, or the same volume mounted at a separate mount point. You must therefore consider how many volumes to export.

There are no additional requirements for volumes exported to VMware clients. 

.Steps

. Verify that an existing export policy is in place:
+
`vserver export-policy show `

. Verify that the existing export policy rules are appropriate for the trunking configuration:
+
`vserver export-policy rule show -policyname _policy_name_`
+
In particular, verify that the `-clientmatch` parameter correctly identifies the trunking-capable Linux or VMware clients that will mount the export.
+
If adjustments are necessary, modify the rule using the `vserver export-policy rule modify `command or create a new rule:
+
`vserver export-policy rule create -vserver svm_name -policyname _policy_name_ -ruleindex integer -protocol nfs4 -clientmatch { text | "text,text,â€¦" } -rorule security_type -rwrule security_type -superuser security_type -anon user_ID`
+

. Verify that existing exported volumes are online:
+
`volume show -vserver svm_name`
+
. If needed, create new volumes:
+
`volume create -vserver _svm_name_ -volume volume_name -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -size {integer[KB|MB|GB|TB|PB]} -security-style unix -user _user_name_or_number_ -group _group_name_or_number_ -junction-path _junction_path_ -policy export_policy_name`
+
Verify that the volume was created with the desired junction point:
+
`volume show -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -junction`
+
