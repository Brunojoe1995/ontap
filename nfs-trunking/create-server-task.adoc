[lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1P3, trunking can be enabled on NFS servers running v4.1 or later. NFSv4.1 and later are enabled by default when NFS servers are created.

An SVM must be available with the following characteristics:

* Backed by sufficient storage for client data requirements. 
* Enabled for NFS.
* Dedicated to NFS trunking, no other servers should be configured on it.

.Steps

. If a suitable SVM does not exist, create one:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver create -vserver "<svm_name>" -rootvolume "<root_volume_name>" -aggregate "<aggregate_name>" -rootvolume-security-style unix -language C.UTF-8
----

. Verify the configuration and status of the newly created SVM:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver show -vserver "<svm_name>"
----
+
Learn more about link:../nfs-config/create-svms-data-access-task.html[creating an SVM.]

. Create the NFS server:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nfs create -vserver "<svm_name>" -v3 disabled -v4.0 disabled -v4.1 enabled -v4.1-trunking enabled -v4-id-domain "<my_domain.com>"
----

. Verify that NFS is running:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nfs status -vserver "<svm_name>"
----
+
. Verify that NFS is configured as desired:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nfs show -vserver "<svm_name>"
----
+
