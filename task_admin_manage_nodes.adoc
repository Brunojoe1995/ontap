You should switch a node’s workload to its HA partner (takeover) before rebooting.

NOTE: You cannot shut down (halt) a node using System Manager; you must use CLI commands. Also, if the node is halted, you need to use CLI commands to bring it back online.  See link:system-admin/start-stop-storage-system-concept.html[Start or stop a node overview].

.Steps

. Click *Cluster > Overview*.
