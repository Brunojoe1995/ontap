You can enable TLS for NFS connections to secure storage access for NFS clients.

You can configure NFS over TLS on an existing storage VM enabled for link:task_nas_enable_linux_nfs.html[NFS].

.Before you begin
NFS over TLS requires certificates. You can either create an install a CA-signed server certificate on the ONTAP cluster, or you can install a certificate that the NFS service uses directly. Your certificates should meet the following guidelines:

* Each certificate must be configured with the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the NFS server (the data LIF on which TLS will be enabled/configured) as a common name (CN).
* Each certificate must be configured with the IP address of the NFS server as the Subject Alternative Name (SAN).
* You can install multiple NFS service certificates for the same LIF, but only one of them can be in use at a time as part of the NFS TLS configuration.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, and then click *Settings*.

. Click image:icon_arrow.gif[arrow icon] in the NFS tile and then click *NFS over TLS settings*.

. In the *NFS over TLS settings* area, select an NFS network interface for which you want to enable TLS. 
. Click the image:icon_kabob.gif[Options icon] for that interface.
. Click *Enable*.
. In the *Network interface TLS configuration* dialog, include a certificate for use with TLS by selecting one of the following options:
+
* *Installed certificate*: Choose a previously installed certificate from the drop-down list.
* *New certificate*: Choose a common name for the certificate.
* *External CA-signed certificate*: Follow the instructions to paste the contents of your certificate and private key into the boxes.
. Click *Save*.
