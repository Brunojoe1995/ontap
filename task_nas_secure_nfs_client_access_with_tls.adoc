.Steps

. Click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, and then click *Settings*.

. Click image:icon_arrow.gif[arrow icon] in the NFS tile and then click *NFS over TLS settings*.

. In the *NFS over TLS settings* area, select an NFS network interface for which you want to enable TLS. 
. Click the image:icon_kabob.gif[Options icon] for that interface.
. Click *Enable*.
