You can protect your data by replicating it to a remote cluster for data backup and disaster recovery purposes.

Several default protection policies are available. You must have created your protection policies if you want to use custom policies.

.Steps

. In the local cluster, click *Protection > Overview*.

. Expand *Intercluster Settings*. Click *Add Network Interfaces* and add intercluster network interfaces for the cluster.
+
Repeat this step on the remote cluster.

. In the remote cluster, click *Protection > Overview*. Click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] in the Cluster Peers section and click *Generate Passphrase*.

. Copy the generated passphrase and paste it in the local cluster.

. In the local cluster, under Cluster Peers, click *Peer Clusters* and peer the local and remote clusters.

. Optionally, under Storage VM Peers, click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] and then *Peer Storage VMs* to peer the storage VMs.

. Click *Protect Volumes* to protect your volumes. To protect your LUNs, click *Storage > LUNs*, select a LUN to protect, and then click image:icon_protect.gif[Protect icon].
+
Select the protection policy based on the type of data protection you need.

. To verify the volumes and LUNs are successfully protected from the local cluster, click *Storage > Volumes* or *Storage > LUNs* and, expand the volume/LUN view.
