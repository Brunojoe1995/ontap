[.lead]
Create a mirror and vault of a volume to protect data in case of a disaster and to have multiple archived versions of data to which you can roll back. Only the combined mirror-and-vault policy is supported. You cannot specify separate mirror and vault policies.

This procedure creates a mirror-and-vault policy on a remote cluster. The source cluster and destination cluster use intercluster network interfaces for exchanging data. The procedure assumes the link:task_dp_prepare_mirror.html[intercluster network interfaces are created and the clusters containing the volumes are peered] (paired). You can also peer storage VMs for data protection; however, if storage VMs are not peered, but permissions are enabled, storage VMs are automatically peered when the protection relationship is created.

.Steps

. Select the volume or LUN to protect: click *Storage > Volumes* or *Storage > LUNs*, and then click the desired volume or LUN name.

. Click image:icon_protect.gif[alt=Protect button].

. Select the destination cluster and storage VM.

. The asynchronous policy is selected by default. To select a synchronous policy, click *More Options*.

. Click *Protect*.

. Click the *SnapMirror (Local or Remote)* tab for the selected volume or LUN to verify that protection is set up correctly.
