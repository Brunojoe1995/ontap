ONTAP uses the ONTAP Mediator to detect when a failure occurs on the primary storage system and executes automatic unplanned failover to the secondary storage system. You can use System Manager to reverse the relationship and reestablish the original protection relationship when original source cluster is back online.

.Steps
.	Navigate to *Protection > Relationships* and wait for the relationship state to show “InSync.”
.	To resume operations on the original source cluster, click image:icon_kabob.gif[kabob icon] and select *Failover*.
