Storing data in tiers can enhance the efficiency of your storage system. You can manage storage tiers by using FabricPool to store data in a tier, based on how frequently the data is accessed.

This procedure sets up an object store as the cloud tier for FabricPool. Keep in mind that once you attach to a local tier (aggr) the cloud tier cannot be unattached.

Starting August 21, 2021, a new Cloud Tiering BYOL licensing was introduced for tiering configurations that are supported within Cloud Manager using the Cloud Tiering service. link:cloud-install-fabricpool-task.html[Learn more about installing a FabricPool license].

If you are tiering to ONTAP S3, there are additional requirements:

* There must be an entry for the remote ONTAP S3 serverâ€™s hostname in the DNS server configured for the admin storage VM, including the S3 server's FQDN name and the IP addresses on its network interfaces.
* link:task_dp_prepare_mirror.html[Intercluster network interfaces] must be configured on both local and remote clusters, although cluster peering is not required.

You also have the option to create a volume tiering policy in System Manager.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Tiers > Add Cloud Tier* and select the object store provider you want to use.

. If you want to create a cloud mirror, click *Add as FabricPool Mirror*.

A FabricPool mirror provides a method for you to seamlessly replace a data store, and it helps to ensure that your data is available in the event of disaster.
