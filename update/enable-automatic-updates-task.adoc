Enabling automatic updates allows ONTAP to download and install firmware, system, and security updates without your intervention.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can enable automatic updates to allow ONTAP to download and install firmware updates without your intervention. Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, automatic system updates that include automatic Time Zone Database updates have been added. Beginning in ONTAP 9.16.1, you can enable automatic updates to download and install security updates for link:../anti-ransomware/enable-arp-ai-with-au.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP/AI)].

.Before you begin

* You must have a current support entitlement. This can be validated on the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/[NetApp support site^] in the *System Details* page.

* To enable automatic updates, you must first enable AutoSupport with HTTPS. If AutoSupport is not enabled on your cluster, or if AutoSupport is enabled on your cluster with another transport protocol, you will be given the option to enable it with HTTPS during this procedure.

NOTE: AutoSupport OnDemand is enabled by default and functional when configured to send messages to technical support using HTTPS transport protocol.

.About this task

Depending on your version of ONTAP, the settings on the *Enable automatic updates* page for firmware, system, or security files will be set to either update automatically or show notifications. Be sure to confirm that these settings are correct for your environment before completing the appropriate version-specific procedure.
