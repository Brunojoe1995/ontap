Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can enable automatic updates to allow ONTAP to download and install firmware updates without your intervention. 

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, these automatic updates also include automatic Time Zone Database updates.

.Before you begin
You must have a current support entitlement. This can be validated on the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/[NetApp support site] in the *System Details* page.

.Steps

. In System Manager, click *Events*.
. In the *Overview* section, next to *Enable automatic update*, click *Actions>Enable*.
. If you do not have AutoSupport with HTTPs enabled, select to enable it.
. Accept the terms and conditions and select *Save*.
