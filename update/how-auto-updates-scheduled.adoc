[.lead]
The timeframe in which an automatic update is scheduled for installation varies based upon the priority level of the update and the percentage of systems in your environment that require the update.   

For example, if 10% or less of your total systems are eligible for a non-priority update, the update is scheduled for all eligible systems within 1 week.  However, if 76% or more of your total systems are eligible for a non-priority update, then the update is staggered across the eligible systems over the course of 8 weeks.  This staggered installation helps to mitigate risks to your overall environment if there is an issue with an update that needs to be remedied.

The percentage of your total systems scheduled for automatic updates by week areas follows:
