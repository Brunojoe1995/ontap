With System Manager, you can apply a firmware update to supported devices in your cluster, such as disks, disk shelves, the service processor (SP), or the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC).

== Prepare for firmware update

To prepare for a smooth firmware update, you should reboot the SP or BMC before the update begins.

.Step

. Reboot the SP or BMC prior to the update: `system service-processor reboot-sp -node node_name`

== Update firmware manually

.About this task

Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can receive alerts from Active IQ that inform you when firmware updates are pending on the cluster.  Then, you can download the firmware image and upload it using System Manager.
