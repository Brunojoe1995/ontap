As part of creating an FPolicy policy configuration, you need to create an FPolicy event. You associate the event with the FPolicy policy when it is created. An event defines which protocol to monitor and which file access events to monitor and filter.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, users can receive notifications for failed file operations due to lack of permissions. These notifications are valuable for security, ransomware protection, and governance.  Include the parameter `-monitor-fileop-failure` when creating an FPolicy event and set to `true` in order to monitor access denied operations.

NOTE: This feature can be consumed only through the 3rd Party Integration for FPolicy or NetApp Cloud Secure. All customers using FPolicy can make use of this feature.

.Before you begin

You should complete the FPolicy event link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nas-audit/fpolicy-event-config-worksheet-reference.html[worksheet].

.Steps

. Create the FPolicy event by using the `vserver fpolicy policy event create` command.
+
`vserver fpolicy policy event create -vserver vs1.example.com -event-name event1 -protocol cifs -monitor-fileop-failure true -file-operations open,close,read,write`

. Verify the FPolicy event configuration by using the `vserver fpolicy policy event show` command.
+
`vserver fpolicy policy event show -vserver vs1.example.com`
