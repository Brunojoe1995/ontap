[.lead]

You can modify FPolicy configurations by modifying the elements that make up the configuration. You can modify external engines, FPolicy events, FPolicy scopes, FPolicy persistent stores, and FPolicy policies. You can also enable or disable FPolicy policies. When you disable the FPolicy policy, file monitoring is discontinued for that policy.

You should disable an FPolicy policy before modifying its configuration.
