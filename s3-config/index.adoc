[.lead]
You can use ONTAP 9 CLI commands to configure S3 client access to objects contained in a bucket in an SVM. The procedures include examples and advanced configuration options.

You should use these procedures if you want to configure S3 object storage in the following way:

* You want to provide S3 object storage from an existing cluster running ONTAP.
+
ONTAP deployment is appropriate if you want S3 capabilities on existing clusters without additional hardware and management. For deployments larger than 300TB, NetApp StorageGRID software continues to be the NetApp flagship solution for object storage.

* You want to use the command-line interface (CLI), not System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want the ability to specify which aggregates are used for buckets, you can only do so using the CLI.
====

* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
+
Details about command syntax are available from CLI help and ONTAP man pages.

+
Additional information about ONTAP technology and interaction with external services is available in the ONTAP Reference Library and in Technical Reports (TRs).

* You have cluster administrator privileges, not SVM administrator privileges.
