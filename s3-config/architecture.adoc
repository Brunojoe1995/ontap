In ONTAP, the underlying architecture for a bucket is a FlexGroup volume--a single namespace that is made up of multiple constituent member volumes but is managed as a single volume.

Buckets are only limited by the physical maximums of the underlying hardware, architectural maximums could be higher. Buckets can take advantage of FlexGroup elastic sizing to automatically grow a constituent of a FlexGroup volume if it is running out of space. There is a limit of 1000 buckets per FlexGroup volume, or 1/3 of the FlexGroup volume's capacity (to account for data growth in buckets).

[NOTE]
====
No NAS or SAN protocol access is permitted to the FlexGroup volume that contain S3 buckets.
====

Access to the bucket is provided through authorized users and client applications.
