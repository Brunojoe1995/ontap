S3 objects are kept in _buckets_--they are not nested as files inside a directory inside other directories.

.Before you begin

An SVM containing an S3 server must already exist.

.About this task

For the CLI, when you create a bucket, you have two provisioning options:

* Let ONTAP select the underlying aggregates and FlexGroup components (default)
 ** ONTAP creates and configures a FlexGroup volume for the first bucket by automatically selecting the aggregates. It will automatically select the highest service level available for your platform, or you can specify the storage service level. Any additional buckets you add later in the SVM will have the same underlying FlexGroup volume.
 ** Alternatively, you can specify whether the bucket will be used for tiering, in which case ONTAP tries to select low-cost media with optimal performance for the tiered data.
* You select the underlying aggregates and FlexGroup components (requires advanced privilege command options)
 ** You have the option to manually select the aggregates on which the bucket and containing FlexGroup volume must be created, and then specifying the number of constituents on each aggregate. When adding additional buckets:
  *** If you specify aggregates and constituents for a new bucket, a new FlexGroup will be created for the new bucket.
  *** If you do not specify aggregates and constituents for a new bucket, the new bucket will be added to an existing FlexGroup.
See xref:../flexgroup/index.html[FlexGroup volumes management] for more information.
+
When you specify aggregates and constituents when creating a bucket, no QoS policy groups, default or custom, are applied. You can do so later with the `vserver object-store-server bucket modify` command.

*Note:* If you are serving buckets from Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you should use the CLI procedure. It is strongly recommended that you manually select the underlying aggregates to ensure that they are using one node only. Using aggregates from both nodes can impact performance, because the nodes will be in geographically separated availability zones and hence susceptible to latency issues.

Storage service levels are predefined adaptive Quality of Service (QoS) policy groups, with _value_, _performance_, and _extreme_ default levels. Instead of one of the default storage service levels, you can also define a custom QoS policy group and apply it to a bucket.

link:storage-service-definitions-reference.html[Storage service definitions]

If you are configuring local capacity tiering, you create buckets and users in a data SVM, not in the system SVM where the S3 server is located.

For remote client access, you must configure buckets in an S3-enabled storage VM. If you create a bucket in a storage VM that is not S3-enabled, it will only be available for local tiering.

See the `vserver object-store-server bucket` man pages for additional configuration and display options.

== Create buckets by using the CLI

. If you plan to select aggregates and FlexGroup components yourself, set the privilege level to advanced (otherwise, admin privilege level is sufficient): `set -privilege advanced`
. Create a bucket:
+
`vserver object-store-server bucket create -vserver _svm_name_ -bucket _bucket_name_ [-size integer[KB|MB|GB|TB|PB]] [-comment text] [additional_options]`
+
The SVM name can be either a data SVM or `Cluster` (the system SVM name) if you are configuring local tiering.
+
If you specify no options, ONTAP creates a 5GB bucket with the service level set to the highest level available for your system.
+
If you want ONTAP to create a bucket based on performance or usage, use one of the following options:

 ** service level
+
Include the `-storage-service-level` option with one of the following values: `value`, `performance`, or `extreme`.

 ** tiering
+
Include the `-used-as-capacity-tier true` option.

+
If you want to specify the aggregates on which to create the underlying FlexGroup volume, use the following options:

 ** The `-aggr-list` parameter specifies the list of aggregates to be used for FlexGroup volume constituents.
+
Each entry in the list creates a constituent on the specified aggregate. You can specify an aggregate multiple times to have multiple constituents created on the aggregate.
+
For consistent performance across the FlexGroup volume, all of the aggregates must use the same disk type and RAID group configurations.

 ** The `-aggr-list-multiplier` parameter specifies the number of times to iterate over the aggregates that are listed with the `-aggr-list` parameter when creating a FlexGroup volume.
+
The default value of the `-aggr-list-multiplier` parameter is 4.

. Add a QoS policy group if needed:
+
`vserver object-store-server bucket modify -bucket _bucket_name_ -qos-policy-group _qos_policy_group_`
. Verify bucket creation:
+
`vserver object-store-server bucket show [-instance]`

.Example

The following example creates a bucket for SVM vs1 of size 1TB and specifying the aggregate:

----
cluster-1::*> vserver object-store-server bucket create -vserver svm1.example.com -bucket testbucket -aggr-list aggr1 -size 1TB
----

== Create buckets by using System Manager 

.	Add a new bucket on an S3-enabled storage VM.
..	Click *Storage > Buckets*, then click *Add*.
..	Enter a name, select the storage VM, and enter a size.
+
* If you click *Save* at this point, a bucket is created with these default settings:

**	No users are granted access to the bucket unless any group policies are already in effect.
+
NOTE: You should not use the S3 root user to manage ONTAP object storage and share its permissions, because it has unlimited access to the object store. Instead, create a user or group with administrative privileges that you assign.

**	A Quality of Service (performance) level that is the highest available for your system.

* ##Click *Save* to create a bucket with these default values.##


=== Configure additional permissions and restrictions
##Created this section from some existing information and added WORM info to it##

You can click *More Options* to configure settings for object locking, user permissions, and performance level when you configure the bucket, or you can modify these settings later.

If you intend to use the S3 object store for FabricPool tiering, consider selecting *Use for tiering* (use low-cost media with optimal performance for the tiered data) rather than a performance service level.

If you want to enable versioning for your objects for later recovery, select *Enable Versioning*. Versioning is enabled by default if you are enabling object locking on the bucket. For information about object versioning, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html[Using versioning in S3 buckets for Amazon].

Beginning with 9.14.1, object locking has been enabled on S3 buckets. If you want to lock the objects in your bucket from getting deleted or overwritten, select *Enable object locking*. Locking can be enabled on all or specific versions of objects, and only when the SnapLock compliance clock is initialized for the cluster nodes. Follow these steps:

. If the SnapLock compliance clock is not initialized on any node of the cluster, the *Initialize SnapLock Compliance Clock* button appears. Click *Initialize SnapLock Compliance Clock* to initialize the SnapLock compliance clock on the cluster nodes.
. Select *Governance* to activate a time-based lock that allows _Write once, read many (WORM)_ permissions on the objects. The objects can, however, be deleted by administrator users with specific permissions.
. Select *Compliance* if you want to assign stricter rules of deletion and update on the objects. The objects can be expired only on the completion of the specified retention period. Unless a retention period is specified, the locked objects are never deleted or expired.
. Specify the retention tenure for the lock in days or years if you want the locking to be effective for a certain period.
[NOTE]
Locking is applicable to versioned and non-versioned buckets. Object locking is not applicable to NAS objects.

You can configure protection and permission settings, and performance service level for the bucket.
[NOTE]
You must have already created user and groups before configuring permissions for the bucket.

=== Verify access to the bucket

##Separated this section##

On S3 client applications, that is an ONTAP system or an external 3rd-party application, verify your access to the newly-created bucket by entering the following:

*	The S3 server CA certificate.
*	The user's access key and secret key.
*	The S3 server FQDN name and bucket name.
