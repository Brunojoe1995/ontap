== Object operations

Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, ONTAP S3 supports object metadata and tagging.

* PutObject and CreateMultipartUpload now include key-value pairs using `x-amz-meta-<key>.`
+
For example: `x-amz-meta-project: ontap_s3`.

* GetObject. and HeadObject now return user-defined metadata.
* Unlike metadata, tags can be read independently of objects using:
 ** PutObjectTagging
 ** GetObjectTagging
 ** DeleteObjectTagging

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, ONTAP S3 supports object versioning and associated actions with these ONTAP APIs:

 * GetBucketVersioning
 * ListBucketVersions
 * PutBucketVersioning
