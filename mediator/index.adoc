To install the ONTAP Mediator service, you must ensure all prerequisites are met, get the installation package and run the installer on the host. This procedure is used for an installation or an upgrade of an existing installation.

** Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, you can use any version of ONTAP Mediator to monitor a MetroCluster IP configuration.
** Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use any version of ONTAP Mediator to monitor an SM-BC relationship.

.Before you begin

You must meet the following prerequisites.

include::../_include/mediator-linux-support.adoc[]

NOTE: The kernel version must match the operating system version.

// BURT 1392725
* 64-bit physical installation or virtual machine
* 8 GB RAM
* User: Root access

Any library packages except the kernel can safely be updated but might require a reboot to take affect within the ONTAP Mediator application.  A service window is recommended when a reboot is required.

If you install the `yum-utils` package, you can use the `needs-restarting` command.

The kernel core can be updated if it is being updated to a version that is still supported by the ONTAP Mediator version matrix. A reboot will be mandatory, so a service window is required.

The SCST kernel module must be uninstalled prior to the reboot, then re-installed after the reboot.

NOTE: Upgrading to a kernel beyond the supported OS release for the specific ONTAP Mediator release is not support.  (This likely indicates that the tested SCST module wonâ€™t compile).
