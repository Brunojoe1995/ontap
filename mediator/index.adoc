[.lead]

To install the ONTAP Mediator service, you must ensure all prerequisites are met, fetch the installation package and run the installer on the host. This procedure is used for an installation or an upgrade of an existing installation.

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, you can use any version of ONTAP Mediator to monitor a MetroCluster IP configuration.
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use any version of ONTAP Mediator to monitor an SnapMirror active sync relationship.

== Installation and upgrade considerations

Review the following considerations before you upgrade or install the ONTAP Mediator. 

CAUTION: ONTAP Mediator 1.8 and earlier is not compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux FIPS mode and will prevent it from installing successfully. You can check if FIPS mode is enabled using the `fips-mode-setup --check` command. You can disable FIPS mode using the `fips-modesetup --disable` command. Reboot after disabling FIPS mode to successfully install ONTAP Mediator 1.8 or earlier.

* You should upgrade the ONTAP Mediator to the latest version that is available.  Previous versions of ONTAP Mediator remain backwards compatible with all ONTAP versions but include security patches for all third-party elements.

* When you upgrade to a new ONTAP Mediator version, the installer automatically upgrades to the recommended SCST version unless a higher version is available. For instructions on manually installing a higher SCST version, see link:manage-task.html[Manage the Mediator service]. For supported versions, see the link:whats-new-concept.html#scst-support-matrix[SCST support matrix].
+
CAUTION: If a failure occurs, you might need to upgrade to a later version of ONTAP Mediator. 

* If you install the `yum-utils` package, you can use the `needs-restarting` command.

=== OS requirements 
// BURT 1392725
Your operating system must meet the following requirements:

* 64-bit physical installation or virtual machine
* 8 GB RAM
* 1 GB disk space (used for applications installation, server logs, and the database)
* User: Root access

The following table shows the supported operating systems for each version of ONTAP Mediator.
include::../_include/mediator-linux-support.adoc[]

=== OS upgrade considerations and kernel compatibility
* All library packages, except the kernel, can safely be updated but might require a reboot to apply the changes within the ONTAP Mediator application. A service window is recommended when a reboot is required.
* You should keep the OS kernel up to date. The kernel core can be upgraded to a version that is still supported by the ONTAP Mediator version matrix. A reboot is mandatory, so you should plan a maintenance window for the outage.
** The SCST kernel module must be uninstalled prior to the reboot, then re-installed after the reboot.
** The kernel OS upgrade should not be started without a supported version of SCST ready to re-install. 


[NOTE] 
====
* The kernel version must match the operating system version.
* Upgrading to a kernel beyond the supported OS release for the specific ONTAP Mediator release is not supported. (This likely indicates that the tested SCST module won't compile).

== Register a security key when UEFI Secure Boot is enabled

To install ONTAP Mediator when UEFI Secure Boot is enabled, register a security key before the ONTAP Mediator service can start. The security key is generated by the SCST during the SCST install and is saved as a file to your machine. You enable the file in the Boot Manager. To turn on Secure Boot, sign the screen when you boot up the server.Â 

To determine if the system is UEFI-enabled and Secure Boot is turned on, perform the following steps:

.Steps

. If mokutil is not installed, run the following command: 
+
`yum install mokutil`

. To determine if UEFI Secure Boot is enabled on your system, run the following command:
+
`mokutil --sb-state`
+
The results show whether UEFI Secure Boot is enabled on this system.
+
NOTE: ONTAP Mediator 1.2.0 and previous versions do not support this mode.

== Disable UEFI Secure Boot

You can also choose to disable UEFI Secure Boot before installing ONTAP Mediator.

.Steps

. In the physical machine BIOS settings, disable the "UEFI Secure Boot" option.

. In the VMware settings for the VM, disable the "Safe Start" option for vSphere 6.x or the "Secure Boot" option for vSphere 7.x.
