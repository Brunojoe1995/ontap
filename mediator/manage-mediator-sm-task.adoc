[.lead]
Using System Manager, you can perform tasks to manage the Mediator.

.About these tasks

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use System Manager as a simplified interface for managing a four-node IP configuration of a MetroCluster setup, which can include an ONTAP Mediator installed in a third location. 

Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can use System Manager to also perform these operations for an eight-node IP configuration of a MetroCluster site. Although you canâ€™t set up or expand an eight-node system with System Manager, if you have already set up an eight-node IP MetroCluster system, then you can perform these operations.

Perform the following tasks to manage the Mediator.
