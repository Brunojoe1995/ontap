[.lead]
After the ONTAP Mediator service is installed and running, additional configuration tasks must be performed in the ONTAP storage system to use the Mediator features:

* To use the ONTAP Mediator service in a MetroCluster IP configuration, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/task_configuring_the_ontap_mediator_service_from_a_metrocluster_ip_configuration.html[Configuring the ONTAP Mediator service from a MetroCluster IP configuration^].
* To use SnapMirror active sync, see link:../snapmirror-active-sync/mediator-install-task.html[Install ONTAP Mediator Service and confirm the ONTAP cluster configuration].

== Configure ONTAP Mediator security policies

The ONTAP Mediator server supports several configurable security settings.  The default values for all settings are provide in a low_space_threshold_mib: 10read-only file: 

`/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator.user_config.yaml`

All values that are placed in the `ontap_mediator.user_config.yaml` will override the default values and be maintained across all ONTAP Mediator upgrades.

After you modify `ontap_mediator.user_config.yaml`, restart the ONTAP Mediator service:

`systemctl restart ontap_mediator`

== Modify ONTAP Mediator attributes

The following attributes can be configured:

NOTE: Other default values in the `ontap_mediator.config.yaml` should not be modified.

=== Install third-party SSL certificates  

The following settings are used to install third-party SSL certificates as replacements for the default self-signed certificates.

// Start snippet: numbered list - 2 entries
// No placeholders
. The default variables listed in the table below are included in the following yaml file: `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator.config.yaml` These variables are used to control the certificate files used by the ONTAP Mediator service.

[cols=3*,options="header"]
|===
| Variable 
| Path 
| Definition
| `cert_path` | `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator_server.crt` | X
| `key_path` | `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator_server.key` | X
| `ca_cert_path` | `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ca.crt` | X
| `ca_key_path` | `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ca.key` | X
| `ca_serial_path` | `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ca.srl` | X
| `cert_valid_days` | `1095` | This is used to set the expiration of client certificates to three years.
| `x509_passin_pwd` | `pass:ontap` | The passphrase for the signed client certificate. If third-party certificates are required, you must overwrite the variables in: `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator.user_config.yaml`.
|===

. The `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/uwsgi/ontap_mediator.ini` file is also  required. Here is an example of the default certificates:
// Start snippet: bulleted list - 3 entries
// No placeholders
** `set-placeholder = mediator_cert = /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator_server.crt`
** `set-placeholder = mediator_key = /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator_server.key`
** `set-placeholder = ca_certificate = /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ ca.crt`
// End snippet

Once you make the required changes, restart the the ONTAP Mediator service. For more information on replacing default certificates with third-party certificates, refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/mediator/manage-task.html#replace-self-signed-certificates-with-trusted-third-party-certificates[Replace self-signed certificates with trusted third party certificates].
// End snippet

=== Password attack protection

Settings that provide protections against brute-force password guessing attacks.
 
+
To enable the feature, set a value for the `window_seconds` and the `retry_limit`
+
Examples:
+
--
** Provide a 5-minute window for guesses, and then reset the count to zero failures:
+
`authentication_lock_window_seconds: 300`

** Lock the account if five failures occur within the window timeframe:
+
`authentication_retry_limit: 5`

** Reduce the impact of brute-force password guessing attacks by setting a delay that occurs prior to rejecting each attempt, which slows the attacks.
+
`authentication_failure_delay_seconds: 5`
+
....
authentication_failure_delay_seconds: 0   # seconds (float) to delay failed auth attempts prior to response, 0 = no delay
authentication_lock_window_seconds: null  # seconds (int) since the oldest failure before resetting the retry counter, null = no window
authentication_retry_limit: null          # number of retries to allow before locking API access, null = unlimited
....
-- 

=== Password complexity rules 

Fields that control the password complexity rules of the ONTAP Mediator API user account.
+
....
password_min_length: 8

password_max_length: 64

password_uppercase_chars: 0    # min. uppercase characters

password_lowercase_chars: 1    # min. lowercase character

password_special_chars: 1      # min. non-letter, non-digit

password_nonletter_chars: 2    # min. non-letter characters (digits, specials, anything)
....

=== Control of free space 

Setting that controls the required free space on the `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator` disk.
+
If the space is lower than the set threshold, the service will issue a warning event.
+
....
low_space_threshold_mib: 10
....

=== Control of reserve log space

Setting that controls RESERVE_LOG_SPACE.
+
The ONTAP Mediator server by default installation creates a separate disk space for the logs.  The installer creates a new fixed-size file with a total of 700 MB of disk space to be used explicitly for Mediator logging.
+
To disable this feature and use the default disk space, perform the following steps:
+
--
. Change the value of RESERVE_LOG_SPACE from "`1`" to "`0`" in the following file:
+
`/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/tools/mediator_env`
+
. Restart the Mediator:
+
.. `cat /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/tools/mediator_env | grep "RESERVE_LOG_SPACE"`
+
....
RESERVE_LOG_SPACE=0
....
+
.. `systemctl restart ontap_mediator`
--
+

To re-enable the feature, change the value from "`0`" to "`1`" and restart the Mediator.
+
NOTE: Toggling between disk spaces does not purge existing logs.  All previous logs are backed up and then moved to the current disk space after toggling and restarting the Mediator.
