[.lead]
After the ONTAP Mediator service is installed and running, additional configuration tasks must be performed in the ONTAP storage system to use the Mediator features:

* To use the ONTAP Mediator service in a MetroCluster IP configuration, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/task_configuring_the_ontap_mediator_service_from_a_metrocluster_ip_configuration.html[Configuring the ONTAP Mediator service from a MetroCluster IP configuration^].
* To use SnapMirror active sync, see link:../snapmirror-active-sync/mediator-install-task.html[Install ONTAP Mediator Service and confirm the ONTAP cluster configuration].

== Configure ONTAP Mediator security policies

The ONTAP Mediator server supports several configurable security settings.  The default values for all settings are provide in a low_space_threshold_mib: 10read-only file: 

`/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator.user_config.yaml`

All values that are placed in the `ontap_mediator.user_config.yaml` will override the default values and be maintained across all ONTAP Mediator upgrades.

After you modify `ontap_mediator.user_config.yaml`, restart the ONTAP Mediator service:

`systemctl restart ontap_mediator`

== Modify ONTAP Mediator attributes

The following attributes can be configured:

NOTE: Other default values in the `ontap_mediator.config.yaml` should not be modified.

* *Settings used to install third-party SSL certificates as replacements for the default self-signed certificates*
+
....
cert_path: '/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator_server.crt'
key_path: '/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator_server.key'
ca_cert_path: '/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ca.crt'
ca_key_path: '/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ca.key'
ca_serial_path: '/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ca.srl'
cert_valid_days: '1095'                   # Used to set the expiration on client certs to 3 years
x509_passin_pwd: 'pass:ontap'             # passphrase for the signed client cert
....

* *Settings that provide protections against brute-force password guessing attacks* 
+
To enable the feature, set a value for the `window_seconds` and the `retry_limit`
+
Examples:
+
--
** Provide a 5-minute window for guesses, and then reset the count to zero failures:
+
`authentication_lock_window_seconds: 300`

** Lock the account if five failures occur within the window timeframe:
+
`authentication_retry_limit: 5`

** Reduce the impact of brute-force password guessing attacks by setting a delay that occurs prior to rejecting each attempt, which slows the attacks.
+
`authentication_failure_delay_seconds: 5`
+
....
authentication_failure_delay_seconds: 0   # seconds (float) to delay failed auth attempts prior to response, 0 = no delay
authentication_lock_window_seconds: null  # seconds (int) since the oldest failure before resetting the retry counter, null = no window
authentication_retry_limit: null          # number of retries to allow before locking API access, null = unlimited
....
-- 

* *Fields that control the password complexity rules of the ONTAP Mediator API user account*
+
....
password_min_length: 8

password_max_length: 64

password_uppercase_chars: 0    # min. uppercase characters

password_lowercase_chars: 1    # min. lowercase character

password_special_chars: 1      # min. non-letter, non-digit

password_nonletter_chars: 2    # min. non-letter characters (digits, specials, anything)
....

* *Setting that controls the required free space on the `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator` disk.*
+
If the space is lower than the set threshold, the service will issue a warning event.
+
....
low_space_threshold_mib: 10
....

* *Setting that controls RESERVE_LOG_SPACE.*
+
The ONTAP Mediator server by default installation creates a separate disk space for the logs.  The installer creates a new fixed-size file with a total of 700 MB of disk space to be used explicitly for Mediator logging.
+
To disable this feature and use the default disk space, perform the following steps:
+
--
. Change the value of RESERVE_LOG_SPACE from "`1`" to "`0`" in the following file:
+
`/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/tools/mediator_env`
+
. Restart the Mediator:
+
.. `cat /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/tools/mediator_env | grep "RESERVE_LOG_SPACE"`
+
....
RESERVE_LOG_SPACE=0
....
+
.. `systemctl restart ontap_mediator`
--
+

To re-enable the feature, change the value from "`0`" to "`1`" and restart the Mediator.
+
NOTE: Toggling between disk spaces does not purge existing logs.  All previous logs are backed up and then moved to the current disk space after toggling and restarting the Mediator.
